Canadians staunchly support our universal health care system  according to polls over many years. We live longer  healthier lives than Americans  and our survival rates for cancer and other diseases are comparable. The father of universal health coverage in Canada  Tommy Douglas  is considered a national hero. Like much of Europe  Canada considers access to health care a right on par with the right to food and shelter. In a country where medical bankruptcy is almost unheard of  we are reminded of our privilege every time we read about the shortcomings of the American health care system. None What Americans may not realize is that most Canadians are just as terrified of your system as you may be of ours (which  in fact  are several province-level systems). But sometimes that mix of pride  defensiveness and terror of American-style health care makes it hard for us to admit where Canada falls short. None For example: Most provinces don’t cover prescription drugs for most people. Many people live in remote  sparsely populated areas where specialized care is hard to get. Indigenous peoples and many new immigrants and refugees face complex barriers to health care access. And long waits for non-urgent services like hip replacements or M.R.I. scans for back pain are a genuine problem in many parts of our country. More than a third of Canadians wait more than two months to see a specialist  and 18 percent of Canadians wait at least four months for elective surgery. But it’s important to recognize that long waits are not an inherent feature of all universal health care systems — many countries in Europe and elsewhere with strong universal systems don’t experience these problems. What’s different is that in Canada  doctors and hospitals have a high degree of autonomy  and don’t always participate in efforts to reduce waits. At times they have opposed attempts to have other professionals care for patients or to shift resources into needy communities. And we have been slow to adopt virtual care  group-based care  and other models that would reduce waits. The solutions to delays in Canada lie in changing how we deliver health care services  not how we pay for them. More robust dialogue is needed to really tackle these important problems — but the long American shadow chills our discussions. Fear of an American-style market-based system inhibits a national conversation about how to expand the breadth of coverage and increase the timeliness of services. Instead of talking about how to make our system better  we’re talking about how much worse things are in the United States. And such behavior is evident on both sides of the border: Instead of closing their insurance coverage gaps  many Americans are busy pointing fingers at our difficulties. It’s an absurd habit that needs to end so that both countries can engage in more meaningful debate about how to fix our systems. In truth  neither country performs as well as it should aspire to do. For our part  Canadians must tackle a culture of incrementalism that stops us from expanding services and improving how they’re delivered. I know many doctors in the United States who would say the same about your system. The opportunities and challenges of rapid technological advances and an aging population don’t respect international borders. It would help us all if both countries stopped making each other a boogeyman to excuse their own paralysis.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/16/upshot/would-americans-accept-putting-health-care-on-a-budget.html,Would Americans Accept Putting Health Care on a Budget?  Advertisement Supported by The New Health Care The intuitive appeal of such a system is growing  and it’s getting a test in Maryland.  None If you wanted to get control of your household spending  you’d set a budget and spend no more than it allowed. You might wonder why we don’t just do the same for spending on American health care. None None Capping hospital spending raises concerns about harming quality and access. On these grounds  hospital executives and patient advocates might strongly resist spending constraints in the United States. None That brings us to Maryland’s experience with a capped system. The evidence from the state is far from conclusive  but this is a weighty and much-watched experiment for health researchers  so it’s worth diving into the details of the latest studies.  Starting in 2010 with eight rural hospitals  and expanding its plan in 2014 to the state’s other hospitals  Maryland set global budgets for hospital inpatient and outpatient services  as well as emergency department care. Each hospital’s budget is based on its past revenue and encompasses all payers for care  including Medicare  Medicaid and commercial market insurance. Budgets for hospitals are updated every year to ensure that their spending grows more slowly than the state’s economy. None None None None None Led by Eric Roberts  a health economist with the University of Pittsburgh  the study examined how Maryland achieved its Medicare savings  using data from 2009-2015. Like RTI’s report  it also compared Maryland hospitals’ experience with that of comparable hospitals elsewhere. However  unlike the RTI report  Mr. Roberts’s study did not find consistent evidence that changes in hospital use in Maryland could be attributed to global budgeting. His study also examined primary care use. Here  too  it did not find consistent evidence that Maryland differed from elsewhere. Because of the challenges of matching Maryland hospitals to others outside of the state for comparison  the authors took several statistical approaches in reaching their findings. With some approaches  the changes observed in Maryland were comparable to those in other states  raising uncertainty about their cause. None Changes brought about by the Affordable Care Act  which also passed in 2010  coincide with Maryland’s hospital payment reforms. The A.C.A. included many provisions aimed at reducing spending  and those changes could have led to hospital use and spending in other states on par with those seen in Maryland. A limitation of Maryland’s approach is that payments to physicians are not included in its global budgets. “Maryland didn’t put the state’s health system on a budget — it only put hospitals on a budget ” said Ateev Mehrotra  the study’s senior author and an associate professor of health care policy and medicine at Harvard Medical School. “Slowing health care spending and fostering better coordination requires including physicians who make the day-to-day decisions about how care is delivered.” None “Maryland hospitals are only beginning to capitalize on the model’s incentives to transform care in their communities ” said Joshua Sharfstein  a co-author of the editorial and a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “This means that as Maryland moves forward with new stages of innovation  there is a great deal more potential upside.” As former secretary of health and mental hygiene in Maryland  he helped institute the Maryland hospital payment approach.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/11/health/ebola-africa-vaccine.html,Ebola Erupts Again in Africa  Only Now There’s a Vaccine Advertisement Supported by Global Health None None Two days after a laboratory confirmed that the virus had killed two people in the remote Equateur Province  teams from the country’s health department  along with doctors from the World Health Organization and Doctors Without Borders  had reached Bikoro  a market town about 20 miles from Ikoko Ipenge  the village at the outbreak’s epicenter. The teams are expected to have a 15-bed treatment center and a mobile laboratory in place by this weekend  said Dr. Peter Salama  the W.H.O.’s deputy director general for emergency response. “It’s going to be tough  and it’s going to be costly to stamp this out ” Dr. Salama said at a news conference in Geneva. Health agencies soon plan to deploy a new Ebola vaccine for the first time since it was proved effective two years ago. If it succeeds in halting the outbreak  the vaccine may permanently change the way the world responds to Ebola and greatly lessen the terror surrounding the disease. Ebola kills about half its victims  often through horrific bleeding from all the body’s orifices. It is thought to circulate in bats  occasionally breaking out to infect people or apes that people sometimes eat. The virus is transmitted in blood  feces and many bodily fluids  and by sex. As of Friday  32 cases with Ebola symptoms and 18 deaths had been reported  the outbreak was believed to have started in early April. It was not confirmed as Ebola until Tuesday  when the National Institute for Biomedical Research in the country’s capital  Kinshasa  found the virus in two of five samples taken there for testing. Bikoro is about 500 miles upriver from Kinshasa  but reaching it by road takes about two days and requires four river crossings by ferry. Its airstrip is too decrepit and overgrown to allow supplies to be flown in  Dr. Salama said. Ikoko Ipenge is three more hours away  over dirt tracks usually traversed only by motorbikes. As is common in Ebola outbreaks  the disease appeared to be killing medical personnel and people who touch or wash bodies at funerals. At least one nurse was among the dead. Although the province is remote  the disease could spread. Bikoro is less than three hours by road from Mbandaka  a city of one million people  and it sits on the shores of Lake Tumba  which empties into the Congo River  on the other side of which is the Republic of Congo. The rapid multiagency reaction is driven in part by memories of 2014  when the Ebola virus appeared in West Africa for the first time. None The W.H.O. released $1 million from its emergency fund this week to fight the new outbreak  and the United Nations contributed $2 million more. The W.H.O. also opened its operations center  making plans to send to the country about 50 epidemiologists  clinicians and experts in logistics  infection control  communications and vaccination. The W.H.O. will also ship protective gowns  aprons  boots and masks for caregivers  as well as bleach spray  body bags and other equipment. The Wellcome Trust  Britain’s equivalent of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation  has donated $2.7 million to the effort  and the British government’s development agency donated $1.3 million. “We know from previous outbreaks that the D.R.C. is ready to act  but they need global support to ensure this outbreak is contained effectively ” said Dr. Jeremy Farrar  director of the Wellcome Trust. None None Because the vaccine is still unlicensed  the W.H.O. will have to approve releasing it for emergency use or the Congolese government will have to officially declare its use as part of a clinical trial  probably run by Doctors Without Borders  Dr. Berkley explained. “The country is requesting it  and the response is underway ” he said Friday. The vaccine must be kept cold  but it is packed in liquid-nitrogen-cooled containers meant to withstand days of transit over rough roads in hot weather  he said. There was another Ebola outbreak in the D.R.C. last year  also in a remote area  the province of Bas-Uélé. But before the vaccine could be rolled out  the virus was stopped by methods used in earlier outbreaks — health workers in protective gear isolating the sick and burying the dead. Ultimately only eight infections were confirmed  and four of the victims died. The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine was in development for many years before the 2014 outbreak  but no one paid for clinical trials to prove it worked. The trial that proved it effective was organized only in that epidemic’s waning days  when there were just a few cases. Several other vaccines are also in development  including candidates from Johnson & Johnson  GSK  Russia and China. Donald G. McNeil Jr. reported from New York  and Nick Cummings-Bruce from Geneva.

(It is sometimes called a “pesticide synergist.”) None It is hard to find new insecticides suitable for nets  because they must kill or repel mosquitoes and yet be safe for the babies and youngsters who sleep under them. The insecticides also must be able to stand up to washing and intense sunlight. Piperonyl butoxide largely fades away after two years. In the study’s second year  protection by nets with piperonyl butoxide had diminished  and malaria prevalence in children was reduced by only 33 percent. Insecticide-impregnated nets are considered an important factor in the world’s recent success against the disease: malaria deaths dropped 60 percent between 2000 and 2015. Other factors included coating walls inside homes with long-lasting pesticides  prophylactic treatment of pregnant women and young children during malaria seasons  new rapid malaria tests and treatment using compounds based artemisinin  which comes from wormwood plants.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/books/review-doing-harm-maya-dusenbery-ask-me-about-my-uterus-abby-norman-invisible-michele-lent-hirsch.html,Three Views of the Crisis in Women’s Health Advertisement Supported by Books of The Times None A woman receives a breast cancer diagnosis and opts for a mastectomy — only for her doctor to object: “But you aren’t married.” A young girl suffering from endometriosis  a condition in which uterine cells migrate to other areas of the body  is informed by her doctor that childbirth will ease the pain. “I’m only 11 ” she later tells her support group  baffled. A woman complains of vomiting uncontrollably  up to 100 times a night. She is offered antidepressants. When it finally occurs to a doctor to examine her further  to discover and perform surgery on her barely functioning gallbladder  she is on the verge of death. These aren’t tales from the dark ages of medicine. They are ordinary modern realities documented in Maya Dusenbery’s well researched  wonderfully truculent new book  “Doing Harm ” one of a cluster of new investigations into gender bias in medical treatment that also includes “Ask Me About My Uterus ” by Abby Norman  and “Invisible ” by Michele Lent Hirsch. To put it kindly: These books are a mixed bag. Dusenbery  the editor of the website Feministing  is the most capable writer of the bunch  and “Doing Harm” is an orderly blizzard of studies and statistics examining sexism at every level in medicine  from medical school admissions on up. The journalists Norman and Hirsch  on the other hand  offer up more personal takes — valuable if ungainly melds of memoir and reportage marked by excellent intentions and awkward prose. In “Ask Me About My Uterus ” Norman recounts years of unexplained pain later discovered (by her) to be endometriosis. In “Invisible ” Hirsch looks at how chronic sickness reshapes the personal and professional lives of young women — while invoking the Job-like torments of her own 20s  when she endured thyroid cancer  hip surgery  Lyme disease and a rare condition called mast-cell activation syndrome  which could cause her to go into anaphylactic shock at any time. Taken together  these three books tell an alarming story about how difficult it is for women to access quality care  particularly those women suffering from poorly understood autoimmune disorders. This is hardly breaking news. One member of the feminist collective that produced the 1971 women’s health manual “Our Bodies  Ourselves” said that “everyone had a ‘doctor story’—that is  a tale about male physicians who were sexist  paternalistic  judgmental or simply unable to provide the information women needed.” None In “Doing Harm ” this cultural distrust of women — ancient and ingrained — is shown to govern quality of care at every stage of treatment. Women with abdominal pain wait in emergency rooms for 65 minutes compared with 49 minutes for men   and young women are seven times more likely to be sent home from a hospital while in the middle of a heart attack. Doctors rarely communicate (or understand) how drugs from aspirin to antidepressants affect women and men differently. Autoimmune disorders have been understudied because  as Hirsch points out  three-fourths of the patients are women and it is considered a woman’s ailment  never mind that 37 million people are afflicted  as estimated by the American Autoimmune Related Diseases Association. (In comparison  15 million Americans have cancer.) None For women of color  especially black women  the situation is even more parlous. Black patients are 22 times less likely to get any kind of pain relief in emergency rooms. And Dusenbery reports on a disturbing 2016 study of more than 200 medical students who were presented absurd  made-up statements on race and medicine. Half gave credence to statements like: Black people have less sensitive nerve endings than white people. Addressing such entrenched inequities requires more than bringing more women doctors into the fold. As Norman learns the hard way in “Ask Me About My Uterus ” women doctors are not immune from implicit bias. Nor will a greater number of women doctors make up for the fact that  to this day  men are the default objects of study for research. A 2005 study found that almost 80 percent of animal pain studies used only males. A 1986 study on the influence of obesity on breast and uterine cancer infamously failed to enroll any women in the study. According to Virginia Woolf  writing about the sick body (“this monster ” “this miracle”) requires the courage of a lion tamer and the spirit of a philosopher. Not all these books meet that exalted standard. But all three  despite their grim stories and projections  leave the reader galvanized  not despairing. Each of them ends on a similar note — calling for women to keep sharing their “doctor stories ” keep putting pressure on medical professionals to study women’s health and  in the meantime  for women themselves to learn how to advocate for their own care. Even as they recognize the burden that sick women must carry (Dusenbery: “Women should not be required to be more knowledgeable about women’s health than their doctors are”)  they are each  in their own flawed  complicated way  the very intervention they seek.

But if the goal is to provide expansive protection of conscience  why are these emphatic new efforts so one-sided  focused solely on the plight of health care workers who refuse care on moral grounds — people whom the department is already equipped to protect — while ignoring those who seek to provide medically accepted services? And more important  why is the nation’s public health agency ignoring patient needs? None The Department of Health and Human Services seems to have forgotten these inclusive roots. None None If the new division is as serious about protecting conscience as it claims to be  it should commit to enforcing the Church Amendment’s existing protections for both refusers and providers of abortion and sterilization services  as Congress intended. More generally  it should recognize that conscientious providers encounter legal and institutional barriers to acting on their convictions. The department should encourage Congress to emulate the Church Amendment’s bidirectional protection in all federal conscience clauses and should use its own policymaking authority to protect providers seeking to promote patient access. None None Given that the Department of Health and Human Services has chosen to emphasize refusal over access  however  it is unlikely to take these crucial steps. Its new division is touted as a bastion of tolerance and inclusiveness. But in reality  it intends to only shield a select few.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/20/health/zika-study-ethics.html,Ethicists Call for More Scrutiny of ‘Human-Challenge’ Trials Advertisement Supported by Global Health None WASHINGTON — Members of a government ethics panel have renewed their criticisms of a controversial study in which volunteers are to be deliberately infected with the Zika virus. In an article published this month in the journal Science  panel members called for the establishment of ethics committees to review the design of such human-challenge studies  which are sometimes used to test vaccines. “There is no way to turn back time ” said Ms. Seema Shah  a bioethicist at the University of Washington who chaired the panel and is a co-author of the new paper. “When you’re asking someone to take a risk that won’t benefit them but may benefit others in the future  you need to know two things — that proper protections are in place  and that it’s really going to move the needle.” With funding from the National Institutes of Health  the investigators plan to inoculate participants with potential vaccines and then to inject them with small doses of the Zika virus to test the vaccines’ effectiveness. The N.I.H. has not yet decided whether the research will proceed. The scientists leading the trial say it is necessary to prevent a future epidemic. But Ms. Shah and other bioethicists convened by the N.I.H. concluded in 2017 that the research had “insufficient value” to justify the risks. People outside the study  such as sexual partners  might also be infected  the panel said. And Zika infection might have unspecified consequences for participants in the long term. But scientists in charge of the study said the panel’s concerns were hypothetical and did not take into account the proposed protocol. They plan to use minimal doses of Zika virus and to quarantine patients in a hospital inpatient unit. The study also would start by enrolling only women — who are less likely to transmit Zika sexually — and would require them to use long-term birth control. “It’s really insulting ” said Dr. Stephen Whitehead  a vaccine researcher at the N.I.H.  said of the panel’s decision. “We’ve been painted as mad scientists who do horrible studies on human beings. But we’re on top of all these risks.” Human-challenge studies are only conducted at a small number of institutions in the United States. The trials have been used to test vaccines or treatments for dengue  malaria  influenza and norovirus  among other diseases. Natural Zika outbreaks are becoming too sporadic to test vaccines  so until the next large outbreak  a human-challenge study may be the only way for vaccine developers to proceed. “This ethics consultation was debilitating for the whole community ” said Dr. Anna Durbin  a research clinician at Johns Hopkins University who collaborated on the study’s design. “It really slammed the door on progress.” None None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,med_and_health
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/magazine/can-doctors-choose-between-saving-lives-and-saving-a-fortune.html,Can Doctors Choose Between Saving Lives and Saving a Fortune? Advertisement Supported by On Medicine None To understand something about the spiraling cost of health care in the United States  we might begin with a typical conundrum: Imagine a 60-something man — a nonsmoker  overweight  with diabetes — who has just survived a heart attack. Perhaps he had an angioplasty  with the placement of a stent  to open his arteries. The doctor’s job is to keep the vessels open. She has two choices of medicines to reduce the risk for a second heart attack. There’s Plavix  a tried-and-tested blood thinner  that prevents clot formation  the generic version of the drug costs as little as 25 cents a pill. And there’s Brilinta  a newer medicine that is also effective in clot prevention  it costs about $6.50 a pill — 25 times as much. None “We thought about this nearly every day when discharging patients from the cardiology unit ” Dhruv Khullar  a newly minted hospital attending  told me. “Some of us believed that a doctor’s job is to deliver the best possible care  period. Others argued that doctors should aim to find some balance between medical benefit  financial cost and social responsibility. It’s the kind of question that we aren’t really trained to solve. Are costs something that an individual doctor should do something about? What is a doctor supposed to do?” None None None None The study’s authors also analyzed the costs of labor  salaries and administration. American doctors and nurses were paid substantially more than their European  Canadian or Japanese counterparts. But as Ezekiel Emanuel  an oncologist and bioethicist  noted in an accompanying editorial in The Journal of the American Medical Association  Americans also have fewer doctors per capita than many other countries  and so these salaries  weighted on a “per patient” basis  are only minimally higher than those in most countries. The administrative burdens were  however  disproportional and unique to American care. In one 2009 survey  the costs associated with doctors and nurses “interacting” with health-insurance plans — a euphemism for those deadly hours spent filling out forms  recording prior authorizations and negotiating with insurers — amounted to more than $23 billion a year. The three major factors identified by the researchers — administrative waste  pharmaceutical price and procedural cost — may provoke familiar-sounding solutions to the costs of health care. Decrease waste by removing unnecessary and burdensome paperwork. Drive down pharmaceutical prices — through negotiation on costs  for instance  or by enabling the introduction of generic alternatives for patent-expired medicines. And limit the use of high-cost  low-value procedures where possible. But what of the Khullar conundrum? What can an individual doctor do to fix health care costs? At first glance  the prescriptions prompted by the study’s authors seem dispiriting: The solutions are abstract and political  and they lie outside the realm of medical practice. Yet if you look more closely  this essential quandary of medicine may require a medical solution. Among the problems of American health care is a startling dissociation between “cost” and “value”: We pay more  but we often don’t get more. How might anyone restore the cost-value balance? In part  of course  through legislative and administrative reform  via political and public pressure. But in part  also  by deploying powerful tools that are newly at our disposal — genetics  epidemiology  computational analysis  biochemistry. None These strategies  if successful  will focus treatments on those most likely to benefit  reducing expenditures and complications. The big hope  yet unfulfilled  is that such treatment will ultimately increase value and decrease overall cost (in recent times  the focusing of medicines on subsegments of patients has resulted only in more expensive drugs). It’s the sort of medicine that might treat medicine’s cost crisis. It’s the kind of problem that a young doctor might learn to love.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/09/magazine/surgical-checklists-save-lives-but-once-in-a-while-they-dont-why.html,Surgical Checklists Save Lives — but Once in a While  They Don’t. Why? Advertisement Supported by On Medicine None Late last year  I witnessed an extraordinary surgical procedure at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. The patient was a middle-aged man who was born with a leaky valve at the root of his aorta  the wide-bored blood vessel that arcs out of the human heart and carries blood to the upper and lower reaches of the body. That faulty valve had been replaced several years ago but wasn’t working properly and was leaking again. To fix the valve  the cardiac surgeon intended to remove the old tissue  resecting the ring-shaped wall of the aorta around it. He would then build a new vessel wall  crafted from the heart-lining of a cow  and stitch a new valve into that freshly built ring of aorta. It was the most exquisite form of human tailoring that I had ever seen. The surgical suite ran with unobstructed  preternatural smoothness. Minutes before the incision was made  the charge nurse called a “time out.” The patient’s identity was confirmed by the name tag on his wrist. The surgeon reviewed the anatomy  while the nurses — six in all — took their positions around the bed and identified themselves by name. A large steel tray  with needles  sponges  gauze and scalpels  was placed in front of the head nurse. Each time a scalpel or sponge was removed from the tray  as I recall  the nurse checked off a box on a list  when it was returned  the box was checked off again. The old tray was not exchanged for a new one  I noted  until every item had been ticked off twice. It was a simple  effective method to stave off a devastating but avoidable human error: leaving a needle or sponge inside a patient’s body. In 2007  the surgeon and writer Atul Gawande began a study to determine whether a 19-item “checklist” might reduce human errors during surgery. The items on the list included many of the checks that I had seen in action in the operating room: the verification of a patient’s name and the surgical site before incision  documentation of any previous allergic reactions  confirmation that blood and fluids would be at hand if needed  and  of course  a protocol to account for every needle and tool before and after a surgical procedure. Gawande’s team applied this checklist to eight sites in eight cities across the globe  including hospitals in India  Canada  Tanzania and the United States  and measured the rate of death and complications before and after implementation. The results were startling: The mortality rate fell to 0.8 percent from 1.5 percent  and surgical complications declined to 7 percent from 11 percent. In the decade that ensued  surgical checklists proved effective in diverse settings. In South Carolina  in hospitals that implemented checklists  the 30-day mortality for certain surgical procedures fell to 2.8 percent from 3.4 percent. In the Netherlands  the deployment of checklists along a patient’s full surgical journey — from admission to discharge — caused a striking decrease in complications and mortality. In 2014  Gawande’s team (now an organization called Ariadne Labs in Boston) started perhaps their most ambitious study on the impact of checklists. This time  the team focused its attention on the practice of childbirth in India: Could adherence to a checklist containing “essential birth practices” reduce the rates of infant and maternal mortality? The Ariadne team identified 60 matching pairs of facilities in cities like Lucknow and Agra in the state of Uttar Pradesh. A 28-item checklist was created: Was a clean towel provided at birth? Were there sterile scissors at hand? Did the birth attendant remember to wash his or her hands? Was the infant’s temperature measured after delivery? An intensive eight-month peer-coaching program to implement this checklist was used in half the paired hospitals. The study enrolled nearly 160 000 pregnant women. The chances of mother or infant dying  or of severe maternal complications  was measured. Despite the team’s strenuous attempts to implement this checklist  there was no discernible impact: The rate of adverse outcomes in the experimental group was identical to the rate in the control group — around 15 percent. About 7 400 babies were stillborn or died within the first week of life. None None None None In particularly risky circumstances  such as the treatment of TB or H.I.V. (in which the risk of drug resistance increases if medicines are taken off schedule)  doctors have resorted to trials that observe patients actually swallowing their medicines in front of a physician’s eyes — a strategy called Directly Observed Therapy. These “DOT” trials work at first  but patients often become noncompliant in the real world once the direct observation ceases. And so  in time  do nurses  hospital staff and birth attendants: In the childbirth trial in India  35 percent of the attendants started off washing their hands during the first months of the study  while coaching and supervision were still active. By 12 months  when the coaching had ceased  that proportion had dropped to 12 percent. We might describe this situation as a “behavioral relapse ” akin to the physiological relapse of cancer or of an immunological illness. Unlike cancer  though  behavioral relapse has no measure: no marker  no biopsy  no powerful predictive test  it remains undetectable by most methods. As much as we need experimental tools to survey human physiology  doctors need experimental tools to understand  survey and change medicine’s least familiar frontier: human behavior.

Several boxes of a liquid nutritional supplement sit on my patient’s tray table. There are a variety of flavors — vanilla  chocolate  strawberry — just as I had ordered. Like many of the patients I see  he has what we call “protein calorie malnutrition ” which accompanies a range of conditions  from failure-to-thrive at home to critical illness in the I.C.U. The elderly and sick are more likely to lose their appetites and eat poorly  and at a time when the body is most dependent on good nutrition  it is betrayed by these symptoms. Untreated  the weak become weaker  the sick become sicker  and a terminal spiral ensues. Supplement shakes like these  with confidence-inspiring names like Boost and Ensure  are marketed aggressively to consumers and health care providers alike as a healthful panacea for all those struggling to take in enough daily calories. The theory behind these drinks is simple and makes sense: They provide a dense and palatable form of calories that can be tolerated even by those who have poor appetite  no teeth  difficulty swallowing or any of the other myriad symptoms that accompany illness. I pick up one of the colorful  cheery boxes and turn it over to look at its ingredient list. My eyes find the first and main ingredient: water. Then the second ingredient by quantity: corn syrup. There  farther down the list  is a milk-derived protein  and then  more sugar. The protein content is only 10 grams. The diminutive Greek yogurt I had that morning before work contained more protein and a fraction of the sugar. A wave of queasy guilt comes over me as I think to myself  “This is how I’ve been treating malnutrition?” Beverages that contain refined sugars like these have been linked in many rigorous studies to metabolic derangements like Type 2 diabetes  heart disease and fatty liver disease. When I see patients in the office  I remind them at every visit to avoid these kinds of heavily processed and sweetened foods and drinks. Food has the potential to be some of the best medicine. But not food like this. As a physician  I need to be able to offer more wholesome and therapeutic options to my patients than what amount to synthetic sugary shakes with a middling amount of protein. Also upsetting is knowing that Medicare and Medicaid are footing the bill. And if the big food giants like Nestlé and Abbott and our hospitals aren’t working to provide more healthful alternatives  then practitioners and patients should work together to come up with their own. I have a few ideas. None For those who don’t like the taste of yogurt  or who are lactose intolerant  nondairy alternatives include almond and soy-based beverages  and high-protein  low-sugar options are readily available In an even more ideal world  hospital food services would use yogurt or nut milks as the base for freshly made smoothies and add nutrient-dense items like avocado  berries  spinach or peanut butter. I admit  this is a tall order  likely to remain the realm of luxury and boutique health care facilities. That said  I have already started recommending these types of smoothies to my outpatient clinic patients and even give them specific instructions and proportions. One of my greatest success stories so far has come with a young female patient who had been struggling with proper nutrition and chronic constipation. Spinach-yogurt smoothies are now a part of her daily routine and she is feeling better. I recognize that there are economic and other forces at play that can hamper these goals. But even if the fresh smoothies I dream of never materialize on my patient’s hospital tray-tables  I will continue to spread my message one patient at a time.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/19/health/epidiolex-fda-cannabis-marajuana.html,F.D.A. Panel Recommends Approval of Cannabis-Based Drug for Epilepsy Advertisement Supported by None WASHINGTON — A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel on Thursday unanimously recommended approval of an epilepsy medication made with an ingredient found in marijuana. If the agency follows the recommendation  as is expected  the drug would be the first cannabis-derived prescription medicine available in the United States. The drug  called Epidiolex  is made by GW Pharmaceuticals  a British company. Its active ingredient  cannabidiol  also called CBD  is one of the chemical compounds found in the cannabis plant  but it does not contain the properties that make people high. That makes it different from the “medical marijuana” allowed by a growing number of states. In those cases  certain patients are legally authorized to smoke or ingest marijuana to treat severe pain  nausea and other ailments. There are already several drugs on the market that are derived from synthetic versions of THC and other chemicals of the cannabis plant  generally used to ease nausea in cancer patients  and to help AIDS patients avoid weight loss. Advocates for development of marijuana-based treatments  and those pushing for better treatments of epilepsy  were pleased with the panel’s recommendation. “This is a very good development  and it basically underscores that there are medicinal properties to some of the cannabinoids ” said Dr. Igor Grant  director of the Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research at the University of California San Diego. “I think there could well be other cannabinoids that are of therapeutic use  but there is just not enough research on them to say.” The panel recommended approval of the drug to treat two rare forms of epilepsy — Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome. They are among the most difficult types of epilepsy to treat  with nearly all patients continuing to have seizures despite currently available medications  according to the F.D.A. The large number of seizures — experts say a person can have multiple episodes a day — puts children at high risk for intellectual and developmental disabilities  as well as death. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome usually appears between ages 3 and 5  and Dravet syndrome earlier. There are an estimated 30 000 children and adults with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and fewer than that with Dravet syndrome. Because the conditions are so rare  GW Pharmaceuticals has received an orphan drug designation for Epidiolex. “It’s very important that we have additional treatments because these patients have very  very difficult to control seizures ” said Dr. Jerzy P. Szaflarski  a neurology professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham  who directs the university’s epilepsy division. “I get questions about cannabidiol almost every day.” The briefing materials prepared for the committee by F.D.A. staff made it clear that the agency supports the application. The F.D.A. wrote that GW Pharma had submitted positive results of efficacy from three randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trials conducted in patients with both diseases. “The statistically significant and clinically meaningful results from these three studies provide substantial evidence of the effectiveness of CBD for the treatment of seizures associated with LGS and DS ” the agency noted. The briefing papers also reported risk of a potentially serious side effect — liver injury — but said it could be managed. Epidiolex would be the first of a new class of drugs to treat epilepsy. The F.D.A. is not bound by advisory committee recommendations but often follows them. Christina SanInocencio  a nurse and founder of the LGS Foundation  hopes it does. “I have a brother with the disorder ” Ms. SanInocencio said. “I’ve met hundreds and hundreds of families who have kids living with it. It’s so devastating. Any new medicine that comes to the market is a really big win for our community.” None None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,med_and_health
https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/10/health/ap-us-med-medical-marijuana-cancer-doctors.html,"Cancer Docs Feel Unprepared  but Recommend Marijuana Anyway Advertisement Supported by None SEATTLE — Nearly half of U.S. cancer doctors who responded to a survey say they've recently recommended medical marijuana to patients  although most say they don't know enough about medicinal use. The results reflect how marijuana policy in some states has outpaced research  the study authors said. All 29 states with medical marijuana programs allow doctors to recommend it to cancer patients. But no rigorous studies in cancer patients exist. That leaves doctors to make assumptions from other research on similar prescription drugs  or in other types of patients. ""The big takeaway is we need more research  plain and simple "" said Dr. Ilana Braun of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston  who led the study published Thursday in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. Patients want to know what their doctors think about using marijuana. In the new study  cancer doctors said their conversations about marijuana were almost always started by patients and their families  not by the doctors themselves. Overall  nearly eight in 10 cancer doctors reported having discussed marijuana with patients or their families  with 46 percent recommending it for pain and other cancer-related problems to at least one patient in the past year. Among those who said they recommended marijuana  56 percent said they did not have sufficient knowledge to do so. ""They're not as close-minded as you might think  and they also feel they have a lot to learn "" Braun said. The survey was conducted in a random sample of cancer doctors  researchers got completed surveys from 237 doctors  or 63 percent. Marijuana is considered an illegal drug by federal officials and federal restrictions have limited research. Last year  the National Academies of Sciences  Engineering and Medicine concluded the lack of scientific information about marijuana poses a risk to public health. There's evidence marijuana can treat chronic pain in adults and medications similar to marijuana can ease nausea from chemotherapy. In the study  67 percent of cancer doctors said they view marijuana as a useful addition to standard pain therapies  with 75 percent saying it posed less risk of overdose than opioids. About half view marijuana as equal to  or more effective than  standard treatments for cancer-related nausea. Marijuana isn't harmless. The National Academies report said pot smoking may be linked to higher chances of traffic accidents  chronic bronchitis from long-term use and schizophrenia and other causes of psychosis  especially in the most frequent users. Dr. Steven Pergam of Seattle Cancer Care Alliance answers questions about marijuana's safety from his colleagues at the treatment center. His responses depend on the patient. A dying patient with cancer that's spread? ""Whatever they want to do to make themselves comfortable "" said Pergam  who wasn't involved in the new research. A patient with leukemia  however  should be warned of a theoretical possibility of a fungal infection tied to cannabis use. ""If we're not comfortable having these discussions  patients will get information from other sources  and it's not going to be as reliable "" he said. ___ Follow AP Medical Writer Carla K.

Like many of the farmers who grow cannabis near the town of Corinto  Aguirre hopes President Juan Manuel Santos' plan to turn Colombia into a major producer of medical marijuana means he can find work from one of a dozen companies launching in the South American nation.  Santos - who leaves office in August - passed a law two years ago legalizing medical cannabis for domestic use and export. It aims to take the marijuana trade from the hands of Marxist rebels and traffickers  transforming Colombia into a multibillion-dollar producer for the pharmaceutical industry. ""We're just realizing marijuana's potential. It could be the next economic bonanza - like coffee was "" said Aguirre  61  before a man and a woman arrived at his farm to buy sacks of dried cannabis buds. ""I could go to jail for this but that won't happen if I'm working in medicinal."" Farmers who want to be part of Colombia's medical marijuana project are required to destroy their illegal crops. Colombia has already issued 33 licenses and hopes to grow as much as 40.5 tons a year of medical marijuana - accounting for roughly 44 percent of licenses issued globally. So far  however  the government has authorized production of seeds and marijuana only for scientific research  not for commercial production of medical cannabis. Andres Lopez  head of Colombia's National Narcotics Fund that oversees use of legal narcotics  said it was putting in place its team to regulate the industry. The new law calls for rigorous testing to prevent illegal cannabis from entering the medical market. In time  growers estimate that the Andean nation could capture as much as one-fifth of a global market that could be worth $40 billion a year - a significant economic boost as Colombia seeks to diminish its reliance on dwindling oil reserves. That would be more than coal exports  and also more than exports of flowers  coffee and bananas combined.  ""Colombia's betting on diversification of exports  of its portfolio and this is one of the most aggressive ways "" said Rodrigo Arcila  head of the cannabis growers association. The new industry will not produce smokable marijuana but focus on oils  creams and inhalers produced in laboratories and personalized by prescription to each patient  he said.  Growers say that production would be enough to treat pain and symptoms of some 4.5 million patients nationally and 60 million in Latin America suffering from conditions such as cancer  multiple sclerosis and epilepsy. With the United States - historically the main market for its illegal marijuana - closed to medicinal imports  Colombia will look to Latin America for sales  Arcila said. Countries including Mexico  Peru and Argentina have legalized its medical use. MARIJUANA STIGMA The World Health Organization has said there is initial evidence that cannabis compound cannabidiol (CBD) could have therapeutic value in the treatment of epilepsy and related conditions. A WHO committee is due to undertake a broad review of cannabis and cannabis-related substances in June. Natalia Tangarife has no doubt about its benefits. Every three months  the 32-year-old travels 150 miles (241 km) from her home in the town of Dosquebradas to a marijuana plot she rents from indigenous farmers in Cauca. She has learnt to extract enough oil from the 40 spiky-leafed plants for her 6-year-old son Jacobo and 30 other children suffering from chronic refractory epilepsy  which is resistant to conventional treatments. ""It was a miracle! When I gave Jacobo the oil he slept all night  he was calm and stopped screaming. I cried "" she said as Jacobo rocked in his wheelchair  his arms and head jerking erratically.  ""In two months  he went from 40 convulsions a day to two."" Yet  since marijuana remains illegal for all but personal use  Tangarife risks being arrested for supplying others.  Some on the political right in Colombia  including former Public Prosecutor Alejandro Ordonez  have opposed the legalization on the grounds it sends the message marijuana is good for your health and could lead to a full legalization of the drug.  Federico Cock  head of Colombia-Canadian-owned Pharmacielo  agrees  but says - in a country where marijuana has long fueled violent crime - that may not be a bad thing. ""We'll go from a bad  negative history to developing a product that destigmatizes the history of Colombia and our sad past "" said Cock  standing among rows of cannabis bushes at a plantation near Medellin - where Pablo Escobar ran his drug trafficking empire in the 1980s. Pharmacielo  which has a 12-hectare operation in Rionegro  was the first company to receive a license in Colombia and Cock hopes to start commercial production by the end of the year - if the government gives final approval.  With banks reluctant to lend to the nascent industry  Pharmacielo is in the process of listing on the Toronto stock exchange  pending regulatory approval. Canada  already at the forefront of the medical cannabis industry  is due to legalize recreational cannabis this year. It will be only the second country to do so  after Uruguay.  While Colombia is several years behind Canada  its lower cost of production due to its less seasonal climate gives a competitive advantage that makes it attractive to investors.  Sidney Himmel  chairman of Toronto-based Khiron Life Sciences Corp  a medicinal cannabis company setting up in Colombia  said the arrival of Canadian companies would encourage investors to lend much-needed capital.  ""The dollars required to fund this are massive "" he said.  FALSE HOPE  Vice Trade Minister Olga Lucia Lozano said the windfall for Colombia could be massive  recalling that its flower industry also began as a collaboration between scientists and farmers and is now the world's second-biggest exporter. ""Drugs have caused more pain than anything else - I have seen friends die "" she said. ""But on those ashes we'll build a new industry.""  Representatives for the leading candidates in the May 27 presidential election - including right-wing frontrunner Ivan Duque and his leftist rival Gustavo Petro - did not respond to requests for comment on their policies on medical marijuana.  Santos wanted medical marijuana to serve as a crop substitution program  allowing thousands of growers to be part of a legitimate industry and to help eliminate the illegal trade. But that idea appears to have gone up in smoke. Companies say they want to develop conflict zones but the number of hectares allowed by their licenses means many existing growers will be shut out.  Pharmacielo  which has a four-hectare pilot project in Corinto  said it can employ about 18 farmers in each hectare  but since the government stipulates that it must provide farmers with a minimum of 10 percent of the total productive land  the farmers have only half a hectare.  ""We've been offered false hope "" said Hector Sanchez  who destroyed his marijuana plants to be part of a medical cooperative and is still waiting to start work. ""If growers can't be involved  they'll just go back to marijuana.""  To create their own medical marijuana business  the farmers would need at least $20 million a year - in laboratory equipment among other costly scientific technology - an amount far from reach.  Corinto's mayor  Eduard Garcia  says legal marijuana could solve many of the region's social problems and prevent youths from joining rebel groups and crime gangs.  It could create far more jobs than nearby sugar plantations  which employ just one worker for every eight hectares  he said.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/17/world/australia/marijuana-legalize.html,Is Australia Ready to Legalize Marijuana? Not Yet  It Seems Advertisement None SYDNEY  Australia — For a brief moment on Monday  marijuana users rallied around a proposal from the Greens party to legalize the drug’s use for recreational purposes in Australia. But those hopes were quashed the next day  as Greg Hunt  the minister for health  said the government would oppose the plan. Marijuana  he said  was a gateway to other drugs like methamphetamines. “Our job is to protect the health of Australians ” he said on Tuesday. “This action by the Greens risks the health of Australians.” Here’s what you should know about the marijuana debate in Australia. None Advertisement As with alcohol and tobacco  cannabis sales would be taxed. Revenue would go to the federal budget to fund education  treatment and harm-reduction programs. Advertisement None Possession of marijuana for recreational purposes is illegal in Australia. It’s the most widely used illicit drug in the country. According to a report from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare  one in 10 Australians have used cannabis in the last 12 months. In some states  like the Australian Capital Territory  South Australia and the Northern Territory  possession of small amounts of marijuana has been effectively decriminalized  with offenders facing civil penalties like fines and being ordered to undergo counseling. In other states  like New South Wales  Victoria and Queensland  police officers often issue warnings to those facing minor drug charges  with offenders diverted to education programs. Cultivating  selling or transporting marijuana  however  can incur criminal charges anywhere in the country. “If somebody is found with small amounts of cannabis for personal use  the primary response for me isn’t a law enforcement response  it’s a public response ” says Professor Steve Allsop of the National Drug Research Institute at Curtin University. “Putting people into the criminal justice system creates harm.” None Advertisement None Damien Cave  our new Australia bureau chief  shares insights on global news  local recommendations and feedback from readers in this weekly newsletter.

But dozens of other countries have relaxed their marijuana laws over the years  legalizing medical marijuana  decriminalizing recreational use or easing the enforcement of possession laws. Argentina  Cambodia  Canada  Spain  the Netherlands  Colombia  Peru and (somewhat surprisingly) North Korea are just some of the countries that don’t criminalize marijuana use. None None For now  Australia’s government says no. And being careful and conservative in legalizing marijuana might not be such a bad thing  Professor Allsop said. “If you legalize a form of drug use — once you’ve done that it’s very hard to go backwards ” he said. “There should be carefully evaluated steps to change rather than a great leap into the unknown.” It’s unlikely the issue will go away  particularly since legalization has the support of a major political party like the Greens. Professor Allsop  who supports a model like that of Portugal’s  says the push to see drugs as a public health issue seems to be gaining momentum over the long term. “I think there is an appetite to do that ” he said.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/04/us/ted-stanley-dead-fentanyl-lollipop-inventor.html,Ted Stanley  Whose Fentanyl Lollipop Treated Chronic Pain  Dies at 77 Advertisement Supported by None Ted Stanley  an anesthesiologist and medical entrepreneur who  with a colleague  created the fentanyl lollipop  a palatable means of delivering a synthetic opioid analgesic  mostly to cancer patients  died on July 13 in Salt Lake City. He was 77. The cause was complications of prostate cancer  according to the University of Utah  where Dr. Stanley conducted research for 50 years and which  along with him and his drug company  reaped millions of dollars in profits from his discovery. Though prescribed primarily in cancer treatment  the fentanyl-laced lollipop  a sugary  fruit-flavored confection on a plastic stick  has also been used to relieve migraine and cluster headaches  severe back and bone pain  arthritis and other chronic conditions. But like other products containing fentanyl  a synthetic drug that is a hundred times more powerful than morphine or oxycodone  the lollipop formulation has also proved vulnerable to abuse by opiate addicts. They get the product from forged prescriptions  doctors who fraudulently overprescribe  patients who distribute it illicitly and illegal laboratories. Some steal it from pharmacies. It is sold under several generic names  including perc-o-pop. The lollipop version was invented by Dr. Stanley and Brian I. Hague in 1983 and approved by federal regulators in 1998 to treat cancer pain under the name Actiq. None The product was considered a breakthrough because it could be sucked or swabbed in the mouths of patients  including children and old people  who had an aversion to vaccinations or had difficulty swallowing pills. It grew out of research that Dr. Stanley and colleagues had been conducting in Sacramento  Calif.  on an even more potent variety of fentanyl called carfentanil  which was used in darts to subdue game animals and was even considered for use as a weapon against terrorists. “A veterinarian colleague one day wondered whether carfentanil could be injected into the sugar cubes that some of the study team were using that day in their coffee ” Dr. Stanley recalled in 2014 in The Journal of Pain. The colleague wondered whether a sugar cube loaded with carfentanil could be used effectively to immobilize monkeys who become frazzled when they were placed in a restraining cage before receiving injections. “He knew that monkeys love to suck on sugar cubes ” Dr. Stanley wrote. Within an hour  they tested their theory on a monkey. “With a couple of sucks on the sugar cube  he was down  and safely ” Dr. Stanley later recalled. Flying back to Salt Lake City  he said  he wondered  “How could we do this with people? And that’s where the idea of the drug in a lollipop and giving it to a child who needed to have surgery” was born. “I said  ‘What if we had a lollipop that had one of these drugs in it?’ ” he told NPR in 2010  “ ‘and you give the lollipop to the child and then boom  they would be relaxed  they’d go to sleep?’ Then you could take them from their parents  it would be so stressless  and so nice.” In 1985  he and his business partner  William Moeller  founded Anesta Corporation to market the lollipop sedative. Anesta went public in 1994. In 2000  it was sold for nearly $450 million to Cephalon (which has since been acquired by Teva  an Israeli pharmaceutical company). The fentanyl citrate is absorbed in the bloodstream within 20 minutes — as quickly as an injection. That made it useful to treat soldiers injured in the field and in hospital operating and emergency rooms  where quick treatment can be less costly than lengthier drug regimens. The fentanyl in the lollipop retains its potency because  unlike a medicinal patch or a chewed  crumbled lozenge  it is not first digested and then metabolized by the liver. Rather  it is absorbed into veins in the mouth  pharynx and esophagus. Moreover  the lollipop can be self-administered and removed when a patient who is being monitored has received the proper dose. The normal dosage contains about two grams of sugar (well below the American Heart Association’s recommended daily intake of 36 grams for men and 25 for women)  but the lollipop has been known to cause tooth decay. Theodore Henry Stanley was born on Feb. 4  1940  in Manhattan. His father  also named Ted  was a New York City police inspector. His mother  the former Ellen Kasekevitch  was a corrections officer. He graduated from Bushwick High School in Brooklyn. Dr. Stanley grew up as a die-hard fan of the hapless Brooklyn Dodgers. But when his dreams of playing center field in the big leagues faded  and after he concluded that he could not make a living as a musician  either (he played nine instruments)  he said he decided on a medical career as a last resort. He went on to earn a bachelor’s degree in zoology  chemistry and music from Columbia College in 1961  followed by a medical degree from the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons. Studying under a fellowship at the University of Utah  he planned on becoming a cardiac surgeon but added anesthesiology as a specialty. Dr. Stanley served in the Air Force at the medical center of Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio  Tex. He joined the Utah faculty in 1972  becoming a professor of surgical research and director of research at the university’s School of Medicine. None At Utah  he was also a pioneer in partnering with private industry to subsidize medical research and development as federal financial support was shrinking. He later became managing director of UpStart Ventures  which invests in innovative life sciences companies. Dr. Stanley wrote or contributed to scores of books and was frequently published in medical journals. In 2000 he considered the state of anesthesia in modern medicine. “Anesthetic delivery has not appreciably changed in the past 150 years ” he wrote. “We still give drugs using needles. We still ask patients to breathe the vapors of very potent volatile liquids — drugs that could take the paint off a car. We still ask patients to swallow pills and solutions  some of which actually produce the desired effect some of the time.” But he was optimistic that significant progress was not far-off. He predicted that newer anesthetics  some of which might mimic animal hibernation  “promise improved convenience  improved safety  increased effectiveness  increased bioavailability  continuous delivery with fewer peaks and valleys  decreased side effects  decreased dosage and frequency of administration  and decreased cost.” Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,med_and_health
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/15/us/opioid-addiction.html,A Drug to End Addiction? Scientists Are Working on It. Advertisement Supported by Retro Report None Scrambling for ways to contain America’s out-of-control opioid crisis  some experts in the field are convinced that one bit of good advice is to just say no to the enduring “just say no” antidrug message. Addiction  they say  is not a question of free will or a correctable character flaw  as a lot of people would like to believe. Rather  it is an affliction of the brain that needs to be treated as one would any chronic illness. None If it works  the vaccine would stop opioids by effectively blocking them from reaching the brain by way of the circulatory system. At the same time  it would not interfere with other treatments for addicts  like methadone and buprenorphine  or with a compound like naloxone that reverses overdoses. None “It would be part of their therapy for recovering ” Dr. Matyas said of addicts. “If they mess up and take a dose of heroin  the heroin won’t work.” But will the vaccine itself work? It still must be tested on humans  and that is not a speedy process  it could take a decade or more  Dr. Matyas said  for there to be “a licensed product.” Among the questions are how large the dosages would have to be and how often they would need to be administered. Nonetheless  he is encouraged by the success he has had with lab mice and rats. None None None That’s probably reasonable advice to an adolescent who has yet to so much as puff on a marijuana joint or take a swig of booze  said Thomas McLellan  who was deputy director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy in the Obama administration. But it’s another story with someone already on drugs. “If you’re talking about a person who’s addicted to opioids and is in a very bad situation  ‘just say no’ is perfectly ridiculous ” Mr. McLellan told Retro Report. He was equally dismissive of those who regard methadone maintenance and other regimens as no more than crutches that substitute one form of dependency for another. “As a matter of fact  they are a crutch ” he said. But he added  “They make crutches for people who are having trouble standing on their own.” The treatments are no different from  say  insulin injections for diabetics  guiding people through troubled moments when they are “very vulnerable to relapse.” “They’re an insurance policy ” Mr. McLellan said. More to the point  he said  “they reduce craving and  most importantly  they prevent overdoses.” Along that line  the vaccine being developed by Dr. Matyas  which is intended to be effective as well against H.I.V.  the virus that causes AIDS  would in theory block heroin from reaching the brain and binding to protein receptors there. Thus it would (a) eliminate  or at least appreciably minimize  the euphoria that the drug produces in users who relapse  and (b) end the risk of respiratory depression that accompanies an overdose  causing the addict to stop breathing. None The vaccine would not end an addict’s craving for opioids  the immunologist said. As with Mr. Hoffman  relapses are to be expected  and the vaccine would have to be re-administered at regular intervals. But by keeping users from getting high  the medication would greatly reduce the risk of overdoses. That’s the “true vision” of the vaccine  Dr. Matyas said: to ward off the pattern of relapse and overdose that killed Mr. Hoffman and ended a great stage and film talent.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/19/opinion/boehner-marijuana-blacks-prison.html,Boehner Benefits From Weed. Blacks Are in Prison for Using It. Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributors None None None A decade ago  an undercover police officer approached Mr. Winslow  a homeless black man  and asked for help buying marijuana. Mr. Winslow desperately needed the money  so he helped the officer buy two dime bags for a $5 profit. For that  he is serving life without parole for distribution of marijuana in the infamous Angola prison. None None None The problem is with race. As white people exploit the changing tide on marijuana  the racism that drove its prohibition is ignored. So are the consequences for black communities  where the war on drugs is most heavily waged. None Richard Nixon’s war on drugs continued the trend. Consider what his former aide John Ehrlichman told Harper’s Magazine: “The Nixon campaign in 1968  and the Nixon White House after that  had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people ” he said. “We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or blacks. But by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin  and then criminalizing both heavily  we could disrupt those communities.” None None None White entrepreneurs who are cashing in on legal marijuana must work to reverse these trends. People in the marijuana industry  and the lawmakers who help it flourish  should highlight the racist history of marijuana prohibition and acknowledge its continuing impact. The cannabis industry must also press for policies to decriminalize marijuana. It should call for the release of people like Mr. Winslow who sit in jails and prisons for the mere use  possession or sale of marijuana. And it must push legislators  prosecutors and law enforcement officers to throw out convictions derived from marijuana offenses. None More white people should do what Mr. Boehner did and publicly announce their support of sensible marijuana policy. They should draw on their own experiences to undermine the racialized stigma the drug was long tagged with. The reality is that when a problem has a white face  the government and law enforcement agencies are more likely to react sensibly to that problem. As white people make money from marijuana  black people languish in jail for smoking it. None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,med_and_health
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/well/a-perplexing-marijuana-side-effect-relieved-by-hot-showers.html,A Perplexing Marijuana Side Effect Relieved by Hot Showers Advertisement Supported by None By the time Thomas Hodorowski made the connection between his marijuana habit and the bouts of pain and vomiting that left him incapacitated every few weeks  he had been to the emergency room dozens of times  tried anti-nausea drugs  anti-anxiety medications and antidepressants  endured an upper endoscopy procedure and two colonoscopies  seen a psychiatrist and had his appendix and gallbladder removed. The only way to get relief for the nausea and pain was to take a hot shower. He often stayed in the shower for hours at a time and could be in and out of the shower for days. When the hot water ran out  “the pain was unbearable  like somebody was wringing my stomach out like a washcloth ” said the 28-year-old  who works as a production and shipping assistant and lives outside Chicago. It was nearly 10 years until a doctor finally convinced him the diagnosis was cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome  a condition that causes cyclic vomiting in heavy marijuana users and can be cured by quitting marijuana. Until recently the syndrome was thought to be uncommon or even rare. But as marijuana use has increased  emergency room physicians say they have been seeing a steady flow of patients with the telltale symptoms  especially in states where marijuana has been decriminalized and patients are more likely to divulge their drug use to physicians. None “C.H.S. went from being something we didn’t know about and never talked about to a very common problem over the last five years ” said Dr. Eric Lavonas  director of emergency medicine at Denver Health and a spokesman for the American College of Emergency Physicians. Now a new study  based on interviews with 2 127 adult emergency room patients under 50 at Bellevue  a large public hospital in New York City  found that of the 155 patients who said they smoked marijuana at least 20 days a month  51 heavy users said they had during the past six months experienced nausea and vomiting that were specifically relieved by hot showers. Extrapolating from those findings  the authors estimated that up to 2.7 million of the 8.3 million Americans known to smoke marijuana on a daily or near-daily basis may suffer from at least occasional bouts of C.H.S. None Others questioned the one-in-three figure  however. Paul Armentano  the deputy director for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML)  said that even with more widespread use of marijuana  “this phenomenon is comparatively rare and seldom is reported” and strikes only “a small percentage of people.” And several physicians who routinely prescribe medicinal marijuana for conditions ranging from chronic pain to epilepsy said they have not seen the cyclic vomiting syndrome in their patients  but noted that they typically prescribe compounds that are not designed to produce a high and contain very low amounts of the psychoactive ingredient THC. Dr. Habboushe said doctors in other parts of the country may be unfamiliar with C.H.S. or mistake it for a psychiatric or anxiety related syndrome. And even if they are aware of it  many regard it as a “rare  kind of funny disease ” replete with anecdotes of patients who spend hours in the shower. But the condition can be quite serious. One 33-year-old military veteran who asked not to be identified by name described bouts lasting up to 12 hours in which he felt “like a puffer fish with sharp spikes was inflating and driving spikes into my spine from both sides. I’ve broken bones  and this blew it out of the water.” “I know patients who have lost their jobs  gone bankrupt from repeatedly seeking medical care  and have been misdiagnosed for years ” Dr. Habboushe said. “Marijuana is probably safer than a lot of other things out there  but the discussion about it has been so politicized and the focus has been on the potential benefits  without looking rigorously at what the potential downside might be ” he said. “No medication is free from side effects.” Patients often arrive at the hospital severely dehydrated from the combination of hot showers and the inability to keep food or liquids down  and that can lead to acute kidney injury  said Dr. Habboushe. But since many patients develop the syndrome only after many years of smoking pot  they don’t make the connection with their pot habit and have a hard time accepting the diagnosis. The confusion is understandable  Dr. Sorensen said. “Marijuana is viewed as medicinal  and it’s given to people with cancer and AIDS. People know it’s used to help with nausea and stimulate the appetite  so it’s difficult to get patients to accept that it may be causing their nausea and vomiting.” It’s unclear why marijuana can produce such discordant effects in some users. But Dr. Sorensen often tells patients that it’s similar to developing an allergy to a favorite food. Getting the right diagnosis often takes a long time. The average patient makes seven trips to the emergency room  sees five doctors and is hospitalized four times before a definitive diagnosis is made  running up approximately $100 000 in medical bills  Dr. Sorensen’s study found. “They get really expensive workups  lots of CT scans and sometimes exploratory surgery” to rule out dangerous conditions like appendicitis or a bowel obstruction  Dr. Sorensen said. “At the end of the day they’re told  ‘You’re smoking too much pot.’” The symptoms of C.H.S. often do not respond to drug treatment  though some physicians have had success with the antipsychotic haloperidol (sold under the brand name Haldol) and with capsaicin cream. The good news is that C.H.S. has a pretty simple cure: abstinence. Patients stop having pain and vomiting episodes when they quit smoking  experts say. And if they start smoking again  they are likely to have a recurrence. Mr. Hodorowski said he quit smoking once he accepted that marijuana was the cause of his problems  but acknowledges he was in denial for a long time. Now  he says  he’s telling his story so other people can learn from his experience. “I hope they’ll be honest with themselves so they don’t have to go through what I’ve been through ” he said. “I’m very lucky to have survived this.” None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,med_and_health
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/22/us/marijuana-christmas.html,Marijuana for Christmas? Elderly Couple Arrested With 60 Pounds for Gifts Advertisement Supported by None A couple in their 80s were arrested in Nebraska on Tuesday for allegedly transporting 60 pounds of marijuana  worth several hundred thousand dollars  which they told the police they intended to give away as Christmas presents. None Deputies searched the vehicle after smelling the strong odor of raw marijuana and found roughly 60 pounds of it  with an estimated street value of more than $300 000  the department said in a statement. They also found what the department described in a statement as “multiple” containers of concentrated THC  the chemical compound found in cannabis that causes a euphoric high. Mr. and Mrs. Jiron told the police they were traveling from their home state of California to Vermont  with a planned pit stop in Boston  and intended to distribute the drugs to family and friends as Christmas gifts. The use of recreational and medicinal marijuana has been legalized in several states  including California and Massachusetts  but not in Vermont  according to the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. The couple were cited on charges of possession of marijuana with the intent to deliver and of lacking a drug tax stamp  the department said. Lt. Paul Vrbka told The News-Times that Mr. Jiron was being held in the York County Jail while his wife had been cited but not jailed “due to some medical issues.” None The tax on marijuana is $10 per ounce or per portion of an ounce  which means the tax bill for the Jirons would add up to roughly $9 600.
