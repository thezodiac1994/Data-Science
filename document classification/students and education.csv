Jones) tells his principal. It protests censorship in schools and also  maybe  defends a woman’s right to choose and supports Black Lives Matter and opposes mass incarceration and critiques big pharma and mourns the breakdown of the Democratic Party and rebukes the failing separation of church and state and shames the overuse of mayonnaise “on everything  including batter-dipped fried cheese.” None None Mostly these characters talk over and around each other  quibbling over semantics instead of articulating ideas. A lot of the dialogue is forgettable  placeholders enabling the next poem or rant. Honestly  the speech could be less free and less discursive. Several of the actors  directed by Margarett Perry  struggled with the lines. Only the delightful Mr. Boston  whose views seem close to the playwright’s own  appeared to enjoy the language. None But all non-Disney art — conceptual  lyrical  theatrical — is not created equal. The piece that Mick and Bekka ultimately set alight is an effigy of Jesus built from origamied dollar bills and titled “The Almighty Dollar.” Like Bekka’s performance poems  it is unsubtle in its symbolism  obvious in its provocation. There’s a word for this kind of work: juvenile. Still  the play applauds it and it applauds them. Outside the theater  real-life teenagers are organizing behind a political movement that is coherent in its aims and persuasive in its message. I don’t think they’d recognize themselves here.

With their glacial pace toward progress  their hunger for prestige and their liberal partisanship  colleges and universities are hair-pullingly flawed enterprises. Just look at the bounty of ivory tower hand-wringers on Amazon with “reform” in the title. There are just too many colleges out there  all vying for “the best” students. There are too many large lecture halls  and too many lost students. It costs too much. None Ed Life  in the in-house vernacular  has tried to explain this complex world. None As I leaf through back issues  flipping through the college careers of Gen X-ers to millennials to Gen Ys  I see much that provides perspective on what campuses wrestle with even today: None It is 10:30 a.m.  two hours before the Florida Gators will kick off to Ole Miss  and Max  a 19-year-old freshman  is laboring to explain how he feels about the drinking age. “Per-son-al-ly ” he says  punching out each slurred syllable  “I do agree the age should be lowered. It will cut down on binge drinking.” He throws an arm around a fraternity brother. “But we take care of each other. We will not let anyone drink under the influence.” He pauses. “I mean drive under the influence. I’m sorry. I’m drunk already. It’s been a long morning.” None Despite her cheery countenance and assiduous completion of assignments  Ms. DeWitt had already bought razor blades and written a stack of goodbye letters to loved ones.... She researched whether the university returned tuition to parents of students who die by suicide. None College officials have spent decades rolling out one initiative after the next  from scholarships to summer bridge programs to race-conscious admissions  to attract students from underrepresented populations. Since 1980  the percentage of blacks and Hispanics among those attending higher education institutions has more than doubled  from 13 percent to 28 percent in 2014  while the white population has dipped to about 52 percent from 84. Yet administrators might have been missing a trickier truth: Diversity is one thing  inclusion is another. None The question on the floor — and it is being mulled on hundreds of campuses across the country  from the University of California to Bowdoin College in Maine — was how to promote such “fearless sifting” while still creating a welcoming environment for groups that have historically felt slighted at American universities. For while robust intellectual inquiry is a self-stated goal of every university  so too is creating a diverse and tolerant nation. None In 2002  in an award from the Education Writers Association  the judges wrote: “The New York Times for years has offered a rich mix of news  features  human interest  reviews and service journalism in its quarterly education section. They have sustained this high-qualify effort through the thick and thin of advertising  a real credit to the newspaper.” The eccentric aunt has grown thinner over the years. This is the last you’ll see of her as you know her. But The Times promises to continue its commitment to education. A new section will appear some time next year — just as  30 years ago  Education Life replaced a triannual called the Survey of Education. Consider it all part of a continuum. . . .

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/22/opinion/-missing-history-columbia-protests.html,The Missing History of the Columbia ’68 Protests Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor None Mr. Rudd was a leader of the campus protests at Columbia University in April 1968. We entered Barnard and Columbia in the mid-1960s optimistic  eager to learn and proud of our new schools. By the end of May 1968  almost a thousand of us had been arrested  beaten or expelled (as I was) by our beloved university. Beginning on April 23  1968  in an act of protest against the university’s role in the war effort and its plans to expand into nearby Harlem  we had occupied five classroom buildings. The administration  after a week’s hesitation  called in hundreds of police officers  clubs and blackjacks swinging  including the dreaded Tactical Patrol Force  to forcibly remove us  they did it a second time three weeks later. In popular memory  the Columbia protests were a high point of the campus movement against the Vietnam War  and a mile marker in its radicalization. But this history  which privileges the actions and concerns of white students like myself  is incomplete  and it misrepresents what made the protests so powerful — the leadership of the black students. I arrived on campus in 1965 and immediately fell in with a group of campus radicals  who eventually formed the Columbia chapter of Students for a Democratic Society. For years we organized against the war as being unjust and illegal  a war of choice  and fought racism on campus in the form of the university’s refusal to allow mostly black and Latino cafeteria workers to organize a union. In late 1967 we learned that Columbia was affiliated with a military think tank  the university was also moving ahead with plans to build a gymnasium in the city-owned Morningside Park that would have segregated the (mostly white) students from the (mostly black) local residents who would have access. We had grown up in the wake of World War II and watched the civil rights movement take shape in the South  and the university’s support for the war and its institutional racism shook us to our core. We had often wondered whether we would have been “good Germans” under Nazism  or whether we had the moral courage of the civil rights protesters  many of whom were black students our own age. By April 1968  S.D.S. had joined in a loose alliance with the Student Afro-American Society  comprising the more politicized of the few black students at Columbia. On April 23  both organizations found ourselves occupying Hamilton Hall  Columbia’s main undergraduate classroom building. For a time  we even held the dean of the college hostage in his office. There was a difference between us  though. We white kids were ragtag  messy  arguing constantly with each other. We were unsure of what to do once we had occupied Hamilton. But the black students  inspired by the civil rights movement in the South and by their own parents’ lifelong struggles  were certain that they had to barricade the building as their own disciplined statement. None Because of their stand  hundreds and then thousands of students and local residents rallied to the cause  and within two days three more buildings were occupied. Thousands of other people stood vigil outside. “We can’t abandon the black students in Hamilton Hall!” was the universal battlecry. The Columbia administration was terrified of what Harlem might do if the police were called. Administrators waited a week as the occupations and support demonstrations grew  and Columbia became worldwide news. Eventually  the police moved in  arresting the black students without violence. But at the other buildings they indiscriminately and brutally attacked not only the occupiers  but students  professors and even journalists who were outside protesting the police busts. In response most of the student body went out on strike  closing the university for the rest of the semester. The central role played by the Student Afro-American Society has never been acknowledged in accounts of Columbia ’68. The story has been about the white kids of the New Left  the S.D.S. and myself  as a singular protest leader. Ray Brown called the media’s erasure of the black students’ role “strategic blindness.” Ten years ago  about 50 former students who had occupied Hamilton Hall joined with 250 other strike veterans for a 40th reunion at Columbia. Alford J. Dempsey Jr.  now a judge in Atlanta  stunned the white people in the audience when he said  “The time I spent here just about destroyed me.” The only thing worse than the alienation he felt as a black student on the overwhelmingly white campus “was watching my wife die of breast cancer.” The tears in our eyes attested to how little we had understood the lives of our black classmates. Women were similarly written out of the history of the protests. Nancy Biberman  another S.D.S. strike veteran  recently wrote that of about 700 people arrested on April 30  about 200 were women. They provided leadership at crucial actions  in the occupied buildings and in the overall strike committee. The events at Columbia became a symbol and a model of student rebellion for the next two years. I often run into people who tell me that Columbia ’68 changed their lives. As for myself  after a rocky few years pursuing the fantasy of anti-imperialist and socialist revolution  I settled into a lifetime of teaching and organizing. Most of us have spent our lives in professions committed to the common good such as health care  the law  education  social work and labor and community organizing. I do not regret what we did that spring  I hope that young people today can draw inspiration as they design protests around gun control  mass incarceration  racist policing and climate change. But in doing so  it’s imperative that they learn from our mistakes as well. Mark Rudd  a leader of the campus protests at Columbia University in April 1968  is an educator and community organizer.

None None None Samaiyah Lewis  18  Youth Radio Chicago Someone once asked me about the moment when I realized I was black. I always knew to fill in the bubble for African-American whenever I took a survey as a kid  but I never thought too hard about my blackness. Fast-forward to today  I’ve decided I want the sense of belonging that will come from attending a historically black college (HBCU). Even though I have lived on the South Side my entire life  I’ve always attended schools on the North Side  where there aren’t many black and brown students. My high school classmates seemed to view me as the sole representative of my race. I remember being called on to read the poems of Langston Hughes because I mastered the pronunciations of his colloquial euphemisms. I was asked if I shared the cultural practices represented in Chinua Achebe’s “Things Fall Apart.” Another time  I was singled out to answer what feminism means to black women. The expectation that I would educate my white peers became a chore and signaled that I was the token black girl to many of my classmates. I wondered if my friends at predominantly black high schools held these responsibilities. Then I was sitting in a hall recently when a white male teacher walked up to my circle of friends  all of whom are black. He asked if we knew the details of a Black Student Union event at our school. When we all replied we didn’t know  he said: “Well  people have been asking me  and I’m white — I don’t know. I thought you guys would.” It was that moment that got me thinking it was finally time for me to break from the predominantly white institutions I have gone to since kindergarten. Having to enter and exit different worlds on a daily basis has taught me how to relate to and empathize with others who are different from me. But I’ve rarely been afforded the opportunity to identify with people like myself. I was admitted to five HBCUs. My heart told me to pick Howard University. When I visited  it was everything my godmother  a Howard alumna  said it would be. When I saw a classroom filled with black medical students  I felt inspired. It’s my dream to become a psychologist  and seeing the Howard students so focused on their goals made me believe I can accomplish mine too. But Clark Atlanta University gave me a full ride. I chose Clark Atlanta. Graduating with no debt is going to be wonderful  and I can also take classes at nearby Morehouse and Spelman. For the first time  I’ll get to attend an institution that has a variety of courses and extracurricular activities tailored specifically for my educational advancement  as an African-American. I will no longer have to feel like a visitor or a representative sent from elsewhere. I get to belong to a community. Joshua Bailey  17  Youth Radio Atlanta H-O-W-A-R-D G-E-O-R-G-I-A T-E-C-H Those are the letters I keep seeing in bold print across the chests of two students who attend my high school. Their sweatshirts embody the choice lots of students are making: a historically black college  or a state school? In my case  to call it a choice is slightly misleading. Money is one of the biggest factors shaping my college decision. I’m only rich in innovative ideas  potential and the drive to be successful. When I realized that colleges don’t offer full-ride scholarships through recruitment mail  I stopped opening the dozens of envelopes flooding my mailbox. I didn’t want to let myself fall in love with a campus or start fantasizing about how the sweatshirt would look on my Instagram account  because there was no way I could afford it. My high school is also a major influence. I go to a diverse and creative high school in the center of the melting pot of Atlanta. I want my college to reflect that same atmosphere. My lack of interest in an HBCU is surprising to most. But not to my mom  even though she went to Tuskegee University. She understands that I’m looking for a more diverse college experience than the one she had. Studying the Supreme Court decision in Brown vs. Board of Education helped me to be even more confident in my opinion. I know HBCUs have become more diverse  and I respect and understand why they were created: to give African-Americans access to a college education when we had no other option. If I were around when they were established  I would have appreciated that  and I still do. My choice has changed  because the world has changed. When I called my father to tell him I didn’t want to commit to an HBCU  he told me that he didn’t want me to. My dad didn’t attend college and he feels that he was deprived of many opportunities he deserved. He worries that I would also face discrimination  after graduating from a black college. So in the end  I’m heading to Georgia State University. When I arrive on campus  I’ll look around and see what needs to be done  and what I need to do for myself to further my journey in life. And if I feel like there are aspects of campus life that need to change — related to race or anything else — I’ll work to make that change happen. Isn’t that what college is all about? Mali Dandridge  17  Youth Radio Oakland  Calif. I was admitted to my top-choice college  Brown University. On the day college decisions went live online  I squeezed my eyes shut and clicked on the link. When I opened my eyes  confetti exploded across the screen  and there was the word I’d been hoping for: “Congratulations.” Blood rushed to my face  and I started crying tears of joy. But I also immediately began to worry about how I would be perceived as a black girl in the Ivy League  and where I would find my community. The few black Ivy Leaguers I know have all said that at one time or another  they felt slighted because of their race. I grew up hearing stories from my uncle  who went to Harvard in the 1980s. He remembers some of his fellow black classmates being disinclined to speak up  out of fear that they’d be cast as the “dumb black person.” “They let their blackness become their weakness ” is how he put it  and he advised me not to do the same. Their behaviors only reinforced the biased suspicions of many of their classmates and professors at the time: that they were only there because of affirmative action. Seeking comfort  I talked to my mom  who attended Princeton in the ’80s. I hoped that my uncle’s experience was an extreme case. But she said she felt pretty insecure on campus and gave me advice on how to “get through” it all — as if getting through college  not enjoying it  should be the objective. She said she had to have faith in her abilities when others wouldn’t. I found it chilling that her achievement would create so many struggles. I hoped that the illusion of a “diverse” and “accepting” generation in today’s society would protect me from the outright prejudice that my family members endured. But based on microaggressions I’ve faced at school around my college acceptance and other achievements  I know that things haven’t changed all that much. One classmate suggested that I was only elected as a student leader for diversity’s sake  not because I had earned it. Another time  a boy in my class said that race “obviously helped” me get into Brown  without considering my good grades and extracurricular activities  or the role of race in his acceptance to competitive schools as a white male. Brown is known as the “liberal  open-minded” Ivy  and that gives me hope that I can prove my intellect without others making snap judgments about me based on my race. My uncle said that Brown students are weird: “They’re the types to wear mismatching socks to make some sort of political statement.” I thought about my favorite pair of bright yellow socks  my history of bold outfits  and my love of social justice  and smiled. It seems like being different is a badge of honor at Brown  not something to be ashamed of  which is why I think it will be a good school for me  as a black girl.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/us/harvard-asian-admission.html,Asian-Americans Suing Harvard Say Admissions Files Show Discrimination Advertisement Supported by None A group that is suing Harvard University is demanding that it publicly release admissions data on hundreds of thousands of applicants  saying the records show a pattern of discrimination against Asian-Americans going back decades. None The plaintiffs also say that the public — which provides more than half a billion dollars a year in federal funding to Harvard — has a right to see the evidence that the judge will consider in her decision. Harvard counters that the documents are tantamount to trade secrets  and that even in the unlikely event that the judge agrees to decide the case without a trial  she is likely to use only a fraction of the evidence in her decision. Only that portion  the university says  should be released. “This is an important and closely watched civil rights case ” William S. Consovoy  the lawyer for the group  Students for Fair Admissions  said in his letter to the court. “The public has a right to know exactly what is going on at Harvard. Even if this were a commercial issue — as Harvard would like to portray it — the public would have a right to know if the product is defective or if a fraud is being perpetrated.” At stake in the dispute is the secrecy of the university admissions process  especially at elite institutions like Harvard that are competing for a small pool of highly qualified students  and whether and how race and ethnicity play a role. Students for Fair Admissions includes more than a dozen Asian-American students who applied to Harvard and were rejected. They contend in their lawsuit that Harvard systematically and unconstitutionally discriminates against Asian-American applicants by penalizing their high achievement as a group  while giving preferences to other racial and ethnic minorities. They say that Harvard’s admission process amounts to an illegal quota system. A spokeswoman for Harvard  Rachael Dane  while declining to comment on the specifics of the litigation  said: “Harvard College does not discriminate against applicants from any group in its admissions processes. We will continue to vigorously defend the right of Harvard  and other universities  to seek the educational benefits that come from a class that is diverse on multiple dimensions.” Harvard gave the court the documents in question  which include six years of admissions data on hundreds of thousands of high school students  as part of the pretrial discovery process. About 40 000 students apply to Harvard each year. The judge in the case  Allison D. Burroughs of the Federal District Court in Boston  has scheduled a hearing on April 10 for both sides to present oral arguments on whether the documents should be made public. The two sides provided lengthy letters to Judge Burroughs  giving a preview of their arguments. The judge has set a trial date for next January  though Harvard in its letter said it was prepared to go to trial as soon as October. The contents of the documents have been only roughly sketched out in court papers. But Harvard said in its letter that the parties have exchanged more than 90 000 pages  including “deeply personal and highly sensitive information about applicants to and students at Harvard and the inner workings of Harvard’s admissions process.” “Harvard understands that there is a public interest in this case and that the public has certain — though not unfettered — interests in access to judicial materials ” the university said. “Those interests  however  must be balanced against the need to protect individual privacy and confidential and proprietary information about the admissions process.” None One of Mr. Blum’s landmark cases was a lawsuit by Abigail Fisher  a white applicant who said she was denied admission to the University of Texas at Austin because of her race. The United States Supreme Court ruled 4-3 in favor of the university in 2016  saying that it is constitutional to use race as one of many factors in admissions decisions. Critics have seen the lawsuit against Harvard  which seems intended to go to the Supreme Court  as an attempt to reignite that battle. None In its letter to the judge  Harvard said that it had an obligation to protect the identities of applicants  who take it on faith that their applications will remain private. While names and other information that could directly identify applicants have been redacted from the documents  the university said that hometowns  awards and other elements could reveal applicants’ identities through simple internet searches. The documents also include deposition testimony concerning the procedures Harvard used to evaluate applications  internal correspondence among admissions officers about applicants’ qualities  and statements by admissions officers about why they liked some applicants better than others. “That information is highly proprietary to Harvard and of great interest to college admissions consultants and others who seek any advantage they can muster in the highly competitive admissions process ” Harvard said in its letter. Releasing it “would put Harvard at a severe competitive disadvantage ” the university said  and would prompt applicants to try to game the system. Students for Fair Admissions scoffed at the notion that the admissions procedure was akin to a trade secret. “This case does not involve anything like ‘national security  the formula for Coca-Cola or embarrassing details of private life ’ ” the group said  citing case law. The group noted that Harvard officials have repeatedly said that there is no formula for being admitted  and that books and articles have been written about how the Harvard admissions process works. The plaintiffs cited a landmark affirmative action case  Gratz v. Bollinger  in which the Supreme Court ruled in 2003 that the University of Michigan was using an unconstitutional scoring system for undergraduate admissions. The system automatically awarded 20 out of 150 points toward admission to members of underrepresented minorities. “There is no way the public could have understood the dispute ” the group said  “if the facts had been hidden.” None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,students and education
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/arts/columbia-university-1968-protest.html,At Columbia  Revisiting the Revolutionary Students of 1968 Advertisement Supported by None The campus of Columbia University is dotted with monuments to illustrious alumni and high-minded ideals. But on a sunny afternoon earlier this week  about two dozen people gathered around the sundial in its central plaza to pay tribute to a momentous event that has gone uncommemorated in stone. “Horam expecta veniet — await the hour  it shall come ” Frank Guridy  an associate professor of history at the university  proclaimed  reading a Latin inscription on the sundial. “I think it’s sort of poetic that things began here.” None Anniversaries of Columbia 1968 tend to arrive like a classic rock hit  replayed nostalgically by those who were there. But it’s a story  Professor Guridy told the group of current students and former strikers who had gathered for a walking tour of sites relating to the protests  that is only now  as the 50th anniversary approaches  being fully understood. None About a half-dozen former protesters were joined by students who have been researching the history of 1968 in Columbia’s archives  as part of two classes modeled on an earlier one dedicated to exploring the university’s connections with slavery. None None The administration’s decision to call in the police in 1968 was “a serious breach of the ethos of the university.” However much he agreed broadly with the protesters’ opposition to the Vietnam War and support for civil rights  he said  the occupation of buildings “was not necessarily the right way to manifest those viewpoints.” Anniversaries of the strike have tended to reflect the campus politics of the moment. At the 10th anniversary  in 1978  the dominant issue was calls for South Africa divestment  and things turned nearly riotous  as people left a panel discussion and tried to occupy Low Library. None None Some white former strikers expressed complicated feelings about having been asked to leave Hamilton Hall  the first building that was seized in 1968  so that the black students could maintain a separate protest. None None None None “I’m not going to lie  I came over to hear brothers with bass guitars singing ‘Ooo Baby Baby ’” Ms. Spurlock-Evans  who is now senior diversity officer at Trinity College  said. “But I decided to stay  and over that week grew to feel deeply connected to the struggle we had engaged in.” At every stop  the ’68ers filled in Professor Guridy’s narrative with anecdotes  commentaries and corrections  many of which complicated the stereotypical narrative of the strike as a generational rebellion playing out between students and the administration. Recent scholarship has emphasized the close connections between student activists and tenants-rights and other community groups in Harlem  which (then as now  Professor Guridy noted) were often in conflict with Columbia. The mood during the walk was warm and comradely. But participants kept returning to the African-American students’ decision to maintain a distinct protest. In the lobby of Hamilton  both Mr. Brown and Ms. Spurlock-Evans emphasized that it was a strategic decision. The black students  they said  had stronger ties to the surrounding Harlem community  a deeper history of organizing  greater discipline and less tolerance for the revolutionary rhetoric adopted by the most radical whites. Professor Eisenberg  now a historian and a peace activist  was among the white students asked to leave Hamilton (and who then helped occupy Fayerweather Hall). She wondered if the request had helped push the mostly male leaders of S.D.S. to what she called “extreme macho posturing.” “It created psychological need to reaffirm that they were brave  strong and revolutionary ” she said. As with the strike itself  “the bust ” as the police raid is called  unfolded differently at Hamilton. The students  who had indicated they would not resist arrest  were taken away by a black-led police unit without the violence at other buildings. And while other buildings were vandalized (one occupier in Low Library was famously photographed with his feet on the desk of Columbia’s president  Grayson Kirk  smoking his cigars)  Ms. Spurlock-Evans noted that the Hamilton occupiers took care to leave the building as clean as they found it. As the tour concluded  Professor Guridy noted that the protests’s two main demands — canceling the gym and severing ties with a weapons-research institute affiliated with the Defense Department — were ultimately met. Within a year  Mr. Kirk had resigned  a university senate was created and the process of adding courses in African-American history began. None But Professor Guridy said he hoped the strike would still leave one more mark. “They should put a plaque on the sundial ” he said. “It should say  ‘This event happened. It was difficult and violent. But it made our community a better place.’” None None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,students and education
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/24/world/asia/china-metoo-peking-university.html,Students Defiant as Chinese University Warns #MeToo Activist Advertisement Supported by None BEIJING — Students and professors in China denounced a leading university on Tuesday for trying to silence activism about sexual harassment  a rare act of defiance that is testing the limits of the country’s fledgling #MeToo movement. The institution  Peking University in Beijing  remains in an uproar after a student activist said that an instructor accompanied by the student’s mother had visited her dormitory at 1 a.m. Monday to warn her against continuing to speak out about a 20-year-old rape case that had embarrassed the university. None The backlash against the university was swift and fierce. In an unusually bold move  a group of students posted banners accusing the institution of betraying its values  saying that Ms. Yue was upholding the spirit of the May 4 movement of 1919  a patriotic uprising led by students. “What exactly do you fear?” asked the banners  titled “In Solidarity with Our Brave Yue Xin.” They were quickly taken down  and Ms. Yue’s letter and name were censored on Chinese social media. The debate has pitted students and professors against a government that appears increasingly intolerant of dissent. President Xi Jinping  who rose to power in 2012  has discouraged the propagation of Western influence at universities and has urged stricter oversight of classes and professors. None On Tuesday  students continued to share Ms. Yue’s letter online  with some using the public ledger underlying Bitcoin transactions to evade censorship. None The case drew wide attention this month when friends of Ms. Gao  inspired by the #MeToo movement  posted remembrances online. As millions learned of Ms. Gao’s story and anger mounted  Peking University revealed that it had given a warning to Mr. Shen over suspicion of inappropriate behavior after the police investigated the case in 1998. Mr. Shen  now a professor at another Chinese university  has denied the accusations. Ms. Yue said in her letter that administrators had threatened to block her graduation and had forced her to delete documents related to her investigation of the 1998 case. Peking University’s heavy-handed attempts to silence discussion of the case drew widespread rebuke this week. Some students vowed to boycott the university’s 120th anniversary celebration in May with the hashtag #NotMyAnniversary. “Most people are just shocked and confused ” said one student  who gave his name as Martin Shi. “The political atmosphere is getting tense both inside and outside campus.” Yuan Zeng  a 2006 graduate of the university  said its efforts to block discussion of sexual harassment were “stupid and outrageous.” “I’m happy to see students like Yue Xin are courageously fighting for what they believe is right ” said Ms. Zeng  now a media scholar in Hong Kong. Peking University did not answer calls seeking comment on Tuesday. A statement on Monday by the foreign languages school  where Ms. Yue is a student  said the university “respects the basic rights of each student.” As outrage over the treatment of Ms. Yue has grown  commentators have urged the university to work toward reconciliation. People’s Daily  the Communist Party’s main newspaper  published an online commentary on Tuesday saying that “schools and students are not antagonists ” and adding that universities should seek to better understand the thoughts and actions of young people. He Weifang  an outspoken law professor at Peking University  said that many faculty members were upset by the university’s treatment of Ms. Yue  a senior who has campaigned against discrimination of gay  lesbian  bisexual and transgender students. Several other students at the university who have pushed for greater transparency in sexual harassment cases have also reported being intimidated by administrators. Mr. He said that Peking University  as one of China’s most prestigious institutions  had an obligation to be truthful and transparent. “The students’ demands for truth show they are socially responsible ” he said. “The university should apologize for not only what happened years ago but also what happened just now.” None None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,students and education
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/24/nyregion/columbia-graduate-students-strike-union-walkout.html,Columbia Graduate Students Walk Out Over Union Fight Advertisement Supported by None Hundreds of graduate students at Columbia University walked out of classrooms and research labs on Tuesday to press home their right to unionize  in a one-week strike timed for high impact. With classes scheduled to end on April 30  the strike comes at the busiest time of the year  as students gear up for finals  professors wrap up their classes — many taught with the help of graduate teaching assistants who also grade papers and projects — and the campus prepares for commencement. None “The university basically runs on our labor  and we want the recognition ” said Tania Bhattacharyya  28  a sixth-year doctoral candidate in history  who was among the students to grab a bullhorn and lead chants like “What’s disgusting? Union busting!” None “We respect the rights of students to express their views and the rights of all students and faculty to continue their teaching  learning and progress toward degrees ” said Caroline Adelman  a Columbia spokeswoman. But  she added  “we do not understand why the G.W.C.-U.A.W. prefers the pressure tactics and disruption of a strike to a definitive  nonpartisan resolution of that legal question in the federal courts.” None But Columbia has declined to bargain  and with a Trump administration that is less friendly to unions now in charge  the case is expected to eventually find its way before a federal appeals court. If the court rules in Columbia’s favor  the decision could have repercussions for graduate students at other private universities. The U.A.W. represents graduate students at the New School and N.Y.U.  both private schools that voluntarily recognized their unions  as well as at Boston College and several public universities. Other unions  like the American Federation of Teachers  are also active in the movement to organize graduate students. States can choose whether to allow public university graduate students to unionize. None The university’s site promised  “We are taking all necessary steps to minimize the disruption of instruction  to ensure your course objectives are met  and to ensure timely grading.” It also had an F.A.Q. section  with questions like  “Should I be doing the assignments I have due next week?” (Yes.) On Tuesday  at least  the vast majority of undergraduates who were interviewed said that they were sympathetic to the graduate students  and that their academic lives had not yet been disrupted much  other than a few classes and discussion groups being canceled. “I’m supportive  and I think they’re bringing up some really legitimate issues ” said Emma Kolchin-Miller  22  a junior from Amherst  Mass.  majoring in history. “And the grad students have been as helpful as possible to prepare us for the strike.” None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,students and education

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/22/nyregion/students-murder-binghamton-university.html,2 Student Murders Have Binghamton University on Edge Advertisement Supported by None VESTAL  N.Y. — Students at Binghamton University awoke one morning last week to an alert from school officials: A freshman had been stabbed in his dormitory the night before and died. Then  minutes before classes were about to begin  another alert announced that they had been canceled for the day as the police searched for a suspect. None “Nothing like this has happened before ” said Cindy Lin  a sophomore from Staten Island  who saw the swarm of police vehicles from her window the night before. “This is the place we call home. This is where I live most of the year. It was really scary.” There were moments last week when Binghamton could pass for any college campus where students were racing toward the end of the semester. They crossed Peace Quad with friends  bemoaning the essays and exams that stood between them and the coming break  and they still played table tennis in the basement of the student union. Yet students could also sense the anguish and concern that has pervaded the campus and interrupted the usual rhythms of college life. None The distress may not be overt  but it is palpable. “If you’re an outsider and you come to Binghamton  you may not be able to see a difference ” Jermel McClure Jr.  president of the university’s Student Association  said in an interview. “But if you really are in that residential community  if you really know what things are like in terms of people’s spirits being uplifted  you could tell something different is going on here.” None Then  on April 15  Joao Souza  a 19-year-old engineering student from Brazil  was attacked with a knife in his dormitory suite  the police said. Soon after  the authorities released a photograph of a suspect  with the hood of his sweatshirt shielding his face from the camera. Investigators did not disclose a motive for the attack. None Reporters for Pipe Dream typically cover stories like funding for buses and a campus food co-op closing over sanitary violations — the other articles on the front page. Before this semester  Ms. Hupka  the newspaper’s news editor and a sophomore  had never reported on a murder. “I’m not going to lie and say it’s an easy thing to cover ” she said. But  she added  “It has shown me how important my job is.” None School officials said that it was essential to strike a balance between sharing confirmed information and doing so expediently. But Mr. Stenger  the president  said the university would review the episode and its handling of it. “You kind of learn on the fly on these things ” he told reporters after the suspect had been arrested. “We want to make sure that if anything could have been done better  especially in the communication with our community  that we learn from that.” Binghamton University’s sprawling campus of red brick buildings cascades down a wooded hillside above the Susquehanna River. It is about three and a half hours from New York City  just outside of Binghamton  N.Y. On a recent evening  deer grazed near a roadway as students hurried to class and played basketball outside a dormitory. Binghamton  a State University of New York campus considered one of the Northeast’s top public schools  has more than 13 000 undergraduate students. Some of them pointed out the university’s regular place at the top of “best value” college rankings as part of its appeal. Others described being drawn by its inclusive nature. “This is not going to break our community ” said Ms. Lin  who is the student president of the school’s collection of dormitories  including Mr. Souza’s  called Mountainview College. Hundreds of people attended the funeral for Ms. Anderson last month in Westbury  on Long Island  where she was from. The suspect  Orlando Tercero  22  has been apprehended by the authorities in Nicaragua  where he remains as officials in the United States seek to extradite him. Senator Chuck Schumer  a Democrat from New York  has sent a letter to the State Department urging that “all available levers of influence and persuasion should be employed to secure Mr. Tercero’s prompt extradition.” In the second killing  Michael M. Roque  20  was charged with second-degree murder last Monday evening in the death of Mr. Souza. He pleaded not guilty at an initial court appearance. His lawyer declined to comment. Mr. Souza  a first-year student  had joined the Zeta Psi fraternity and lived in Windham Hall  a dormitory that houses many international students and athletes who might need to stay on campus during breaks. He graduated last year from Blind Brook High School in Westchester County. Danielle Goz met Mr. Souza in eighth grade. She said she remembered him struggling with English when he first arrived from Brazil. “He learned so fast ” she said  “and right away everyone just loved him.” She recalled his “promposal ” when he asked her to the dance by surprising her while she was eating with friends. He used sushi to spell out “prom?” (She said yes.) She called him a “poster child” with good grades and athletic ability that helped him become the captain of the varsity soccer team. “Every single person who has encountered him knows how sweet and loving he always was ” said Ms. Goz  18. “My life will not be the same without him  but I will have to find a way to move on. He was my best friend and the best person I knew.” Beyond mourning Mr. Souza’s death  students also expressed disquiet over how the attack had violated a “safe haven — not only for you as an individual but for ideas  discussion  thoughts ” as Mr. McClure  the student body president  described it. “It makes you think about your interactions with the space in a much different way ” Mr. McClure said. “You feel sort of invincible ” he said of the sense of safety that had existed on campus  adding  “It is a reality check.” None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,students and education

Video of the event showed the faculty member approaching individual black students as they danced joyfully in front of a crowd of thousands  then physically moving them offstage. It showed some white students being hurried along  too  but in a less forceful manner. None A number of the graduates were strolling  or performing choreographed dances popular among black fraternities and sororities. They are a common way to celebrate at graduations  and students will often dash off a few quick moves before accepting their diploma. In one case on Saturday  the marshal put both arms around a student  pulling him away. “I was shocked ” the student  Oliver Telusma  21  said in a phone interview on Tuesday. “He literally wrapped his arms around me. I didn’t understand what was going on.” Mr. Telusma  a political science major and member of the Theta Sigma chapter of the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity  recalled trying to regain his footing. None The university’s president  W. Kent Fuchs  apologized on Sunday. None “I personally apologize ” he wrote  “and am reaching out to the students involved.” Mr. Telusma said he had received a voice mail message from Mr. Fuchs  who told him that 21 students were affected and invited Mr. Telusma to get in touch. So far  Mr. Telusma has not called back. He said he needed time to process what had happened. The university’s director of communications  Margot Winick  said in an email that “trainings relating to the graduations are now under review.” The discipline to the faculty member  she added  was “pending a review of the appropriate administrative steps.” That did not sit well with Chris Garcia-Wilde  22  a graduate who walked onstage shortly before Mr. Telusma  a friend. None Mr. Garcia-Wilde said by phone on Tuesday that he and his friends had watched as other students of color ahead of them were hustled along in a “much more physical” way than white students. They had only wanted to celebrate their accomplishments  he said — not only were they receiving their bachelor’s degrees  but Mr. Garcia-Wilde had also been accepted to medical school  and Mr. Telusma was waiting to hear back from law schools. Mr. Garcia-Wilde  who was also a member of Theta Sigma  said that after seeing how other students were treated  he decided not to dance. “I told my friends I wasn’t going to stroll or dance or anything because I was afraid the guy was going to touch me ” he said. “It was really an ugly scene ” he added. “One of the hardest parts for us is it happened in front of everyone  our families. It happened right in front of the administration.” The crowd reacted to the marshal by booing  Mr. Garcia-Wilde said  particularly after the marshal grabbed Nafeesah Attah  whose cap was knocked off her head. None None “The university is framing it as a bad apple situation  but it’s really symptomatic of a larger problem ” he said. What should have been a happy moment was tarnished  Mr. Garcia-Wilde said. “Usually commencement is free of this kind of explicit racism  but not this year  which is really sad ” he said. “My last memory will be me turning around and watching my friend get wrestled across the stage.” None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,students and education

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/education/learning/schools-drone-programs.html,Schools Offering Drone Programs  but Learning to Fly Is Just the Start Advertisement Supported by None None None “From programming  software coding  3-D printing  it’s limitless ” Ms. Alkalay said. “Everything you do with computers and airplanes or helicopters  you can do with drones.” Whether for their potential role in education  entertainment or commercial use  drones (also called unmanned aerial vehicles  or UAVs) have captured the world’s attention. Global sales have more than tripled from three million in 2014 to an estimated 10 million this year  according to statistics from Business Insider Intelligence  a private research company. Over a third of the purchases are in the United States. Colleges have noted this interest  and an increasing number are offering drone classes. Vaughn started an introductory course and the one on law taught by Ms. Alkalay  who formerly led a regional legal office for the Federal Aviation Administration. Five more classes are being planned. At least a half-dozen other colleges  including the aviation behemoth Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University  as well as Kansas State University  the University of North Dakota and Lewis University in Illinois  have gone all in  by offering degrees in drones. And 23 schools in the United States  Canada and Britain have partnered with the F.A.A. to carry out drone-based research programs. “It feels like the beginning of aviation all over again ” said Maxine Lubner  a professor of management at Vaughn. None “I thought it was pretty cool ” said Mr. Espinoza  who is from Mexicali. With a fellow student  Alfredo Martinez  the two set out to build and fly a drone in a national competition. A propeller broke during their first race. A year later  they placed third in a field of six. By objective standards  they did not do well  but that is not how Mr. Espinoza views his experience. “With drones  you apply a lot of things — not just programming and electronics  but mechanics and applying thermal energy ” he said. “You can revolutionize the drones and use them for other things  like research.” While Cetys has a reputation for turning out graduates ready for jobs in industrial and mechanical engineering  the drone courses prepare them for positions with new titles  like innovation engineer and new prototypes designer  said Luis Carlos Básaca  a program coordinator at Cetys School of Engineering. “Working with drones makes our students use all their creativity because they have to think out of the box ” Mr. Básaca said. “They have to think  ‘Which material can make this lighter  more resilient? Which type of motors should I use?’” he added. “These types of questions are very complex. If one  two or three students can build a drone by themselves  they are using their brains to the maximum.” Other educators who use drones in the classroom say Mr. Espinoza’s hit-and-miss experience is not only typical  but also beneficial. None It is difficult to quantify how many schools are using drones in the classroom  although the number is on the increase and more students are demanding these classes  according to Ms. Lubner of Vaughn. Like Cetys  Vaughn offers drone classes that are incorporated into other majors. If anything has held back such education it is the F.A.A.’s restrictive operating rules  some drone proponents say. With few exceptions  drones must fly only in daylight  within the pilot’s line of sight  below 400 feet and away from airports and populated areas. None Still  the limitations have been challenging for drone programs. “If you go outside in a place like New York City it’s impossible to find a place to legally fly ” Ms. Alkalay said. If students “fly in a park and it’s not approved  they’re subject to being hassled or arrested or worse.” As a result  some college students must fly indoors in gyms and auditoriums. None The high school students were enlisted to “measure the footprint of the coverage on the ground ” said David Yoel  chief executive of American Aerospace. The teens aren’t flying the drones but they are learning how the machines can push technology forward  he said. “The future of unmanned aviation is extremely exciting ” Mr. Yoel said. “The market is surging and promises to be as significant as the personal computer revolution and the internet revolution combined.” Now  most commercial drones are used for aerial photography and cartography  along with inspection of rails  crops  towers  pipelines and power lines. A number of businesses are  like the F.A.A.  partnering with universities to find ways to do more with drones. That captured the attention of Mr. Espinoza  who decided to give up on drone competitions and concentrate on a graduate research project. This year  he will participate in the flights of a drone equipped with a special laser camera to create a three-dimensional map of the Cetys campus. As important as drones are today for their role in the evolution of aviation  it is their potential for that kind of research and data-gathering that holds the most promise for students  Mr. Sherman said. “The excitement of the flying machines will fade away  and it will be all about what can the drones do for us.” Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,students and education
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/education/learning/project-based-learning.html,Building Skills Outside the Classroom With New Ways of Learning Advertisement Supported by None None It is also in the words emblazoned on the crimson-colored wall of the Computer-Aided Drafting and Design lab  a quote attributed to Curt Richardson  the founder of OtterBox  which makes consumer electronics accessories: None Wait a minute. Failure  being extolled  even celebrated? In a high school? Yes  in part because this is not a typical school. The center at suburban Mayfield City Schools  a district of 4 300 K-12 students 15 miles east of Cleveland  is a striking example of an approach to education that could eventually make traditional methods as outdated as chalk and blackboards. Mayfield’s model is described as project-based  team-centered  career and industry-aligned learning. None “We believe all students — beginning at a young age — need access to real-world  applied learning experiences that empower them to gain the skills they need to thrive in college  career and beyond.” At programs like Mayfield’s — where 11 teachers have completed Project Lead the Way’s certification since 2014 — that means not only access to state-of-the-art technology  but also partnerships with local organizations to provide those experiences. These include the Cleveland Clinic  which collaborated with the high school this semester in a six-week project in cardiopulmonary education. Eighty-seven students in grades 9 through 12 were assigned cases that required learning about the anatomy of the heart  as well as advanced medical technologies addressing heart disease. Working in teams of five or six  the students used materials like balsa wood and foam board to create three-dimensional models showing specific problems in the heart  and they became immersed in sophisticated virtual reality simulations that allowed them to see a stent being inserted into an occluded artery. None “It’s almost futuristic ” Ms. Held said. “Especially compared to when I was in school.” Keith Kelly  superintendent of the Mayfield City School District  said the center was “about getting kids involved in inquiry  in solving problems  in partnerships  in authentic projects that may be of interest to them.” And it is not just the schools that are driving this. The project-centered approach to education involves industry and colleges as well. Here are some other examples. The Pasadena  Calif.  Unified School District — a district in which 65 percent of the students qualify for free and reduced-price lunches — has nine career-themed “academies” for its high school students. These are learning environments that closely simulate various industries and professional settings  and include an app development lab  a credit union  a digital film studio and even a courtroom. All are supervised by teachers working with advisory boards and mentors from local industry  including such organizations as McDonnell Douglas  Caltech  Kaiser Permanente and Saatchi. Superintendent Brian McDonald calls it a “linked learning” approach — linking core academic content with a strong set of career technical education course and work-based learning opportunities. “I really think this is the future of education ” he said. Toyota has a number of initiatives aimed at funneling students into careers with the automaker  via partnerships with 256 high schools  summer internships for high school students  specialized degree tracks  and part-time employment at the college level and eventually  for those who finish the pathway  jobs. The company’s $10.3 million commitment is intended to address what the program developer  Dennis Dio Parker  calls “the crisis level” shortage of advanced manufacturing technicians facing his industry. “This is self-motivated change ” said Mr. Parker  who is based at the automaker’s Georgetown  Ky.  production support center. “Instead of complaining and griping and pontificating about the educational system  we realized that we had to do something about it.” Toyota  some say  is a model for other industries. “They send a clear signal to all employers that schools can’t do this alone ” said Vince Bertram  president and chief executive of Project Lead the Way. “If we’re going to solve the skills gap  we have to work together.” While many of these innovative programs are STEM-oriented  one partnership between higher and secondary education in Massachusetts seeks to address a different problem: a shortage of nonwhite teachers in the classroom. “As the number of students continues to diversify in terms of race  language and ethnicity  the teachers are still about 90 to 92 percent white ” said Claudia Rinaldi  the director of the education department at Lasell College in Newton  Mass. (Nationwide  the number is about 85 percent.) Lasell’s “Pathways to Teacher Diversity” — part of a statewide effort supported by a Gates Foundation grant — is a partnership with four school districts in the state intended to encourage more high school students of color to pursue careers in education. “Research suggests that when these students have a teacher of color  they do better ” Ms. Rinaldi said. An orientation meeting for the Pathways program a year ago attracted 160 students from the four districts. The first group of 12 is getting college credit for an introductory teaching course  an additional 26 are being mentored by Ms. Rinaldi’s Lasell students. The long-term goal  she said  is to get these students to return  as certified teachers  to K-12 schools like the ones they attended. “The districts are hungry to diversify their teaching force.” None Today  most of the 600 students who attend City-as-School spend about two days per week in traditional classes at its Greenwich Village campus. The other three days  they are involved in internships with one of about 300 organizations — from the Metropolitan Museum of Art to Marvel Comics. There  the students are supervised by employees of the organization (who themselves go through special training)  and also by City-as-School teachers who help their students work through the new and daily challenges of work life. “We have a very real world context for what they’re learning ” said the principal  Alan Cheng. And that was what the founders of City-as-School hoped to foster. The practicality and applicability of education are still the goal  as innovative school programs and their partners seek to reimagine the educational system in the 21st century.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/10/learning/fortnite-freedom-of-the-press-cyberbullying-and-celebrity-opinions-our-favorite-student-comments-of-the-week.html,Fortnite  Freedom of the Press  Cyberbullying and Celebrity Opinions: Our Favorite Student Comments of the Week Advertisement Supported by Current Events Conversation None None None None None None Please note: All the student comments below have been lightly edited for length  but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted. _________ None None For a lot of people  Fortnite is just a game you can play with your friends when you are caught up with your homework after school  to have fun and relax  right? For others  it is a completely different experience. It becomes a bit of a life or death situation  as extreme as it sounds. You have to trust your squad mates with your life  or else  you’re as good as dead. It’s kind of an awesome feeling: you and your friends all together against multiple other groups of friends. You battle it out in building and gun play to defeat your opponents. Overall it is a very fun game  that builds enjoyment and experience in stressful situations that help you build better relationships with your friends. When I play with my friends  we are all in a party  or a chatroom  constantly talking about whatever comes to our minds. Its nothing too serious  until someone hears a gunshot at our squad. “Did you guys hear about what happened in 3rd block today?” *Gunshot* “Shots  330 NW” someone says. The entire conversation changes. From conversation to callouts  in an absolute instant. Your team gets ready to face the coming threat. The addiction itself comes from winning  in my belief. From dropping Salty Springs to running and gunning around the map with a deadly storm pitting the final survivors against one another  to the final battle atop a great mountain  to seeing the words “Victory Royale!” on your screen. It’s a rush of satisfaction and joy  because you won. None An immense topic of discussion is the creeping shadow of “Fortnite ” an online multiplayer shooting game. When I first heard of it  I diminished it as a minor and simple video game that might gain some popularity and die off in the duration of a few months. However  the number one thing that my friends talk about aren’t the plot twists of Infinity War  nor the difficulty of the math test on Tuesday  but whether or not they should buy a skin for their character in Fortnite to look decent enough when they’re firing at another player. Video games alone are addicting  but a game such as “Fornite” has the potential to become a sort of black hole  an endless void that squeezes the reason and sense out of students like myself. The most appealing aspect of Fortnite is the gameplay of a mode called Battle Royale. Well over 30 characters are set down in a continuously shrinking arena  where they can accumulate weapons and tools  build complex structures  and prepare for the battle that will determine to the be the winner. A laughable model of The Hunger Games  I didn’t and still to this day never did understand why my friends would want to play the game  which  to me  was as addictive and attractive as watching paint dry on a wall. However  to my friends  “Fortnite” sees like an island in a sea of mediocre video games  a spark of imagination in a dark time. None I can say from experience that Fortnite is in fact a very addicting and enjoyable game. I recently downloaded because of all the hype  and play it on a regular basis with my friend. I wouldn’t say that I personally am addicted to the game  however  I do find myself playing it in my free time. To be quite honest  I’m not even sure why exactly the game is so popular. The graphics are really pretty and the concept is nice  but it’s just one of hundreds of shooting video games that exist. I do think that at my school  Fortnite has become something that consumes a lot of time from nearly all the students. It’s constantly being talked about and played by students (including myself) during class time throughout the day. I’ve even noticed that people will post all of their wins or the “victory royale” screen on their social media such as on snapchat. Sometimes people will post as much as 4 or 5 pictures of the gaming screen everytime they win  which can end up being really annoying in my opinion. Although this game is so popular and may consume the time of a lot of individuals  I do not believe that it has any truly toxic effects on those who play it. I honestly think it’s just another really hyped up video game that will eventually die down over time. None Hello I’m a 15 year old kid here. After reading this article and scrutinizing the comment section  I have come to the conclusion that people generally have two sides in this lively debate. While some people state that Violent Games (Fortnite or other Games in General) tend to lead to violent aggression  there is other people who believe that games lead to social and life skills. I can agree with both sides of the conversation. For example I play video games as well  with a few wins on fortnite myself I can agree that the game itself is very addicting  This game creates a gambling affect that makes it hard for people to stop  I know that when I am told to stop by my parents  I feel anger  and that’s just not normal. The problem with this is  that this anger is just temporary  I wont feel any more later  but like trying to stop a gambler from playing poker  its really hard to get someone to just stop playing video games. There is also the benefits of video games  from being able to cooperate with each other in a similar social settings  to enhance memory  improve coordination and improves problem solving skills. The solution that my parents and I cooperated  We put up a set of rules for the weekday  I cannot play video games without first studying  doing homework  chores  and even then  the most I can play is around 1 hour 30 min. In the weekend the rules are similar but with a few changes. I cannot play without studying and chores  I can play but I also need to go outside. None I think that its important to recognize that people socialize different ways  and wanting to engage in an activity that they feel comfortable with. Many young people make friends by playing a sport  or participating in a after school activity  and those are both great ways to make friends if that works for you  but many children are just not interested in those activities  and their participation would not be a positive experience for them. Nobody ever calls a child who loves baseball a “baseball addict” in a negative way  and I believe that no one should be criticized with the way that they enjoy themselves. Fortnite is a positive outlet for children to play with friends  feel strong  and have something that they can be proud of accomplishing. Fornite does not create addicts  it creates enjoyable experiences. None Hello. My name is Mekiyah Hazbin  I go to Liberty Middle school and I am currently in the 7th grade. While I’ve read many news articles and heard many opinions. Some say games like Fortnite and PUBG are addicting and ruin social bonds. I completely disagree. When I began playing Fortnite  it was mid October. I didn’t really play the game. When I did  I did it by myself. Then in late December I went over to a friends house. We played Fortnite together for hours. I really began to like this game and by January  it was one of my top games. But  I still didn’t have anyone to play with. That friend played Ps4 and I was on Xbox. That’s when it hit my school. Fortnite began to be in every conversation. I found people I liked to play with. People I would’ve never met if didn’t play. I met people out of state  and out of country. Yet we still play together and chat together as if we’ve known each other for years. Fortnite is addicting because everyone want to be a winner. They want to feel that sense of accomplishment. They want to say  “I’m better than 100 other people.” If people continue to hate on those who play games  they need to stop. Discouraging someone from completing their goals is wrong. Whether the goal is to become a super star or to finally get that victory royale  no one should think they can’t do something. None I have played Fortnite for almost 3 months now and I have never seen violence being an issue in the game play. There are guns in the game  but the game is more like a game of virtual airsoft being that there is no blood and your character doesn’t actually die  but they get teleported off the island. The game is more cartoony and humorous than violent. The characters dance to send taunts and they have weapons like the “boogey bomb” which makes all the players that been hit by the bomb dance for 20 - 30 seconds. For comparison  Fortnite is not much more violent than Tom and Jerry the kids cartoon. Also  kids these days are playing games like Grand Theft Auto where there is much more blood and violence than Fortnite. So I don’t think that Fortnite has too much violence and that it is suitable for younger people. _________ None None My experience with envy has changed through my life. It use to be that when I was little  I had fought or tried to get what I wanted from someone  like a toy. Now  when I see someone with something better then me  I either go like good for you  say how lucky they are compared to me  or do my best to get where they are. That last one is how I hope envy is a part of my adulthood when I grow up  because I think it is a responsible way to use envy to your advantage. None I think that envy is directly related to competitiveness  but it is often confused with jealousy  which can occur without competition. Under Aristotle’s definition  that envy is the feeling of pain from other’s accomplishments  I only feel that pain when comparing myself to a peer  whom I’m in competition with  and not when comparing myself to a stranger. This distinction is important because I don’t think that a little bit of jealousy of a stranger or peer is a bad thing  it only becomes dangerous when their accomplishments convert into personal feelings of anger or despair. One of the ways to overcome hurtful feelings of envy is not to suppress it  but accept it and realize that any comparison or competition between oneself and others is unnecessary. Once the aspect of competition is relinquished  the envy turns into simple admiration. None I think that envy relates to competitiveness mostly in sports. Whenever someone comes before meet in a school cross country meet  it seem that that person get congratulated more. I might have been first for the team last meet but you failed this time and people think better of her. That is how envy feels. Envy continues to grow inside me. Then is spend the next week training harder and harder just to beat so-and-so to get lots of approval. I think that envy is linked to approval or praise in a way. Whenever someone is getting more attention then me  even though we did the same thing  I get envious. It is just our human nature. This is why I agree that envy is related to competitiveness. It might be bad or unsportsmanlike but it is true. At least for me. None I completely agree that social media is a huge source of envy because people typically only see or post the best moments  snapshots  of their lives. Social Media has become a platform to brag about the new award you won  the places you traveled to  or the friendships you made or already had. While social media is an amazing place to express one’s individuality  it also leads to people feeling insecure  less than  or extremely envious of a person they know of or a complete stranger. It makes you take a step back when you realize how often people envy other people’s lives and stop living their own because they are attached to their screen. None Mostly when envy plays in my life its mostly because of looks. When I see women that looks prettier than me  it would bring me down at time . I would just be like...dang I wish I was like that then get mad jealous. None Whenever I envy somebody or something  I am motivated to get whatever I was jealous of. Even when I was little and saw a toy that another little girl had  I saved up  until I got my reward. And now  as a teenager  I use the power of envy as a force in my everyday life. If one of my friends gets a higher grade than me  of course  I would feel envy. So when it came time to take the next exam  I would think back to that moment  and remember what it is that I want: the higher grade. This can be boiled down to competition  because I have a desire to always be on top. _________ None None In my opinion  I think art is best experienced in person. Not that it is impossible for art to be appreciated online or in a book  but to really gain the full experience I think it is best to see them in the flesh. Many of the most famous artworks displayed in museums were made long before art was printed into books and posted on the internet. The artist’s intention was for his/her audience to view them in person  so would that not be the best way to appreciate them? A piece of art that I would love to see in person would have to be a Jackson Pollock piece. By looking at pictures of it online  it is impossible to comprehend the sheer size and the presence it holds in a room. This is one huge drawback you see with viewing art nowadays  because so much of the art we see is online. There is absolutely no way to get the full experience of a piece behind a screen. However  with the internet we can quickly and efficiently see art we would never be able to see without spending money on a plane ticket. Still  I think that the digital era is somewhat ruining the experience of viewing art. It has made it more about visiting museums and having the “I was there” picture than actually appreciating and learning about the art. None Prompt One: I think art is meant to be experience in person. I think the meaning of the art is magnified in person and captured in a way that couldn’t be otherwise. I think visual art should be seen in museums. That way  the viewer can get a personal impression of the work that isn’t digital. For me  music is the most important form of art. I know that I’d rather see any song in person at a live concert than through my earbuds at home. I think seeing music in person generates more emotion as you get the atmosphere of a crowd and it’s almost as though you get to interact with the artist and their music. I think the type of art depends on whether the media should be viewed with a group or as an individual. I think are is meant to be experience both intellectually and emotionally. I think art is meant to appeal to all types of things. Art can not only make you think about certain messages  but also appeal to several emotions. I think this is what makes art so special  there is a type for every individual. None In my opinion  different forms of art are meant to be experienced in different ways. People can have a different outcome of feelings towards a work of art if their experience isn’t the same as another persons. I think works of art like the Mona Lisa are meant to be experienced in person  individually  and emotionally whereas works of art like dances are meant to be viewed online and in a group. This is because so much detail can go into a painting and if its not inspected closely  meaning can be lost. On the other hand  with works like dances  the filming and production of the video can add to the overall routine. Also  a whole group can enjoy and try to participate as the work is playing. Benefits of the digital era with art is editing  production quality  and easier sharing opportunities. The main drawback is people trying to get the experience of art online that is meant to be viewed in person and up close. Overall  I think the digital era is improving the experience of art because technology has opened so many doors and possibilities to create new  groundbreaking types of art. None Art is meant to be experienced in whatever way is best for the viewer to fully receive the full effect and understanding intended by the artist. Whether that method is in person  online or in books  depends on the viewer and their accessibility to the artwork. I think the initial power lies in the artist’s hands to choose a format that they believe will reach and impact the most people. Those people then obtain the power to share the art with others to experience it in different ways. Works of art I would like to see in person are the recent presidential portraits of Barack and Michelle Obama in the National Portrait Gallery in Washington D.C. I want to experience this in person because I think that would be the best way to remember and revel in the existence of a black president and first lady of the United States  whose portraits were created by black artists. That kind of art is weighted in such a rich and painful history that I want to say I have seen with my own eyes in real life. I have seen the portraits online  and though it brought me so much joy  it made me yearn to see it in person. The digital images showed people witnessing the art for the first time in real life. Their reactions prove that seeing it in person can have a great impact also. The digital era was given artists the tools to share their creations with larger audiences. Viewers have the right to seek other ways of experiencing art. I would think the goal of artists would be to share it with the masses. None One of the most beautiful things about art is the fact that nothing about it is set in stone. There are no definitive laws or theories like there are in the natural sciences. Because of this variability  art isn’t meant to be experienced in any single way. Some types of art are best experienced in a museum  which creates a certain atmosphere of seriousness and formality. Seeing the most famous art works in a museum is a very different experience than seeing them in a book or on a screen  and to some  the former might be the best way to experience them whereas for others it may be the latter. It rests on the preferences of the beholder. I once went to the Detroit Institute of Art  and I could have easily spent innumerable hours there  examining the artwork of different ages and areas. It was a very different experience than seeing a painting on a screen. It became more real  more 3-D. This is definitely a drawback of the digital era. We lose the physicality and dimensions of the world on the flat surface of our screens. How can you ever be sure of the height of a mountain if you only ever see a picture? On the other hand  works of art have never been more accessible than they are now. With simply the touch of a button and a few typed words you can view almost any work of art that you want. With technology  we are able to experience so much more art than if we had to travel to see it. Thus  the impact of the digital age on experiencing art can easily be argued both ways. None As the digital age progresses and becomes more influential in our day-to-day lives  art has been forced to change its ways. Originally  a piece of art was meant to be observed in the flesh  allowing us to view each brush stroke on the canvas. Today  art can come in nearly any form. The ability to view art in person is no longer required. Rather  some art is created purely for its online availability. Take a photographer that purely takes photos to be displayed online. Does viewing these photos give us the same experience as viewing them in person would? Probably not  but to say that viewing them would have no worth at all would be to undermine the value of today’s artists. In this way  art isn’t simply meant to be experienced in one specific way. Instead  it takes the form of anything and everything  and the way in which we view it changes our outlook on it. None While it’s disheartening to me that many people only choose to experience art by taking pictures of famous works  I think it’s a sign of a shift in how we can view and create art in the 21st century. Physical art done with oil paint on canvas is now joining other mediums like digital art and cartoons  which can be distributed online  along with pictures of traditional works of art. I believe that this has caused us to see the physical works of art as something sacred  that we must see just for the experience  and take pictures to capture the memory. As Li said  “I can see [the Mona Lisa] better in a book or on the internet.” Of course there are countless ways to experience art  but it may be of value for us to take more time to consider what we really look for in art  rather than just notoriety. To summarize  it’s my belief that in a time when art in all of its forms is so accessible  we should look for art that has meaning for us  not just that which has a famous name attached. None Everyone’s art experience is individual and experienced differently. Art is not meant to be experienced in any specific way. Your take about a piece of art is always going to be different from someone else’s. I consider Seeing art in person always better  for example it makes me feel closer to the artist. Also when I am looking at a work of art  I know that what I am seeing is unique. Seeing it in person gives value to the piece. I admit that sometimes I do visit museums just because an artwork that I am going to see is really famous. But this does not mean that I can’t appreciate it or that it does not transmit me any feelings. Of course right now there are some huge advantages involving art because of the digital era. There is no need to travel or even to move to see art. It could be a real advantage for someone who is unable or does not have opportunities to visit a museum. But also I think that the fact that you only need a click to see a work of art  takes value away from the artists’ job. _________ None None A free press is like a catalyst in a democratic society. Journalism offers a common ground for ideas to be discussed from diverse points of views and promoting a dialog.So that people can form their own opinions  values like impartiality  truth and accuracy should play a key role in the media. If the radio reports that the German government decides to swith off nuclear energy  it has to make sure the facts are right  the opinion reported is not misrepresented and that the pros and cons of this idea are presented to the audience. To support a liberal society that respects diversity  fairness and peace  we need a dissenting press. Demagogues will enjoy impunity with the lack of free press if they are successful in silencing a critical voice in the society. Miss Turkey got into trouble by writing a poem that critiqued Mr. Erdogan. Such instances will continue to happen if press is allowed to be intimidated by these “democratators”. Freedom of speech shouldn’t be misunderstood to be freedom to offend. Journalists are accountable to a pluralistic audience that trusts the press as a source of information to form their views. The press thus has a huge responsibility in keeping a healthy discourse alive to keep democracy alive. None Though it may be interesting or even entertaining  the foremost value of news is as a utility to empower the informed. The purpose of journalism is thus to provide citizens with the information they need to make the best possible decisions about their lives  their communities  their societies  and their governments. News is that part of communication that keeps us informed of the changing events  issues  and characters in the world outside. Though it may be interesting or even entertaining  the foremost value of news is as a utility to empower the informed. None Since the 2016 Presidential Election  I’ve come to realize that the media is incredibly important. Journalism is a line of defense against a powerful government: it is essential to democracy to be aware of what our elected officials are doing! As someone who supports a lot of government regulation  I don’t think news outlets should be censored in any way. My peers insist on the government mitigating news outlets rather than being responsible  aware  and critical of the information they consume online or on television. Censoring the freedom of the press and free speech is also interfering with the first amendment rights of Americans: so what stops the government from stopping people to peacefully protest or worship whichever god(s) they believe in? I do agree that President Trump is a threat to the free press and I don’t think democratic leaders should denounce the media. Leaders should be aware how essential it is to the people they have sworn to serve to be aware of the good and the bad of their policies: not everyone wins in politics  people have to compromise. None I think that the freedom of press is important until a certain point  the press does not have to have the freedom to do whatever they want or to say whatever they want to say because everyone knows how harassing some reporters can be  it is true that their work is important to keep us informed about things that happened around the world. None In my opinion  the purpose of journalism is offers enough information to all of us. It is important for all people in our country  to know more about what happen in each place. Journalism is a means of information very important. Journalists should have absolute freedom of speech everywhere in the world. None Soft censorship by media outlets is a serious problem that does not get enough attention. Sometimes agents of the state and/or corporate entities make it difficult for journalists to report the facts or act impartially. Consider the case of Bela Kosoian  the woman who was handcuffed and fined for not holding an escalator handrail and obstructing police in the performance of their duties. The incident was all over the news in 2009. Journalists at the time sided with the police  saying they were merely enforcing an STM by-law. Had they done their due diligence instead of acting like cheerleaders for the police  they would have discovered there is no regulation requiring commuters to hold the handrail — not then  not now. Ms. Kosoian contested her tickets in municipal court and won. News of her victory was never reported to the masses  whom to this very day live in ignorance of the injustice that was done to her — and by extension to themselves. She is currently going the route of social media with a campaign called 1becomesmany to raise awareness of her challenge to the Supreme Court of Canada on a related matter. She has a Wix blog with an entry called “Yes. Real life can be stranger than fiction”  which will give you cause to question the integrity of our so-called free press. _________ None None Cyberbullying is a nationwide issue and ranges among all ages  not just teenagers. I have never been bullied over the internet but it’s something that most kids my age face everyday. I feel as if social media apps aren’t doing as much as they can for the children and young adults being tormented from cyberbullying. It happens too often for nothing to be changing. The most common apps where people cyberbully would be Facebook and Instagram. Facebook and Instagram can do a lot more then they are now about addressing this problem. None Students love to conceal their embarrassment or the shame of being bullied. I honestly believe that snapchat is where most of the cyber bullying take place. Most students ponder that since snap chat post disappear after 24 hours that it doesn’t matter which is false. I do feel as if social media companies should try to filter what is posted or commented. No one should feel harassed on social media  and I think that they should try to remove the negative comments and etc. For example have someone watch over pages. I think that some students are just trying to crack a joke  but takes that joke a little to far. I am aware of cyber bullying knowing the fact that at one point I was a victim of cyber bullying. I know that the act of bullying will not cease  but I think that their should be more that we can do. None I think Instagram is doing good recognizing and taking action when cyberbullying is spotted. To do even better  Instagram and other social media platforms should encourage users to report cyberbullying. Personally  I found that people feel intrusive or in other people’s business when they report abusive  hurtful comments. On one specific post  I saw a younger girl getting attacked for supporting a highly disliked celebrity. I reported the comments and they were removed within 24 hours. I feel like most social media is doing really well recognizing and fighting against cyberbullying. None I think cyberbullying is a problem for some people. They feel more comfortable doing it behind a screen instead of in person. This does not happen to me  but for many other people it does. It happens on any app where you can talk to another person. People’s feelings get hurt often because others are mean to them. The people that cyberbully have probably been bullied before  so they do it to make them feel better about themselves. A person is most likely to scared to tell someone about it  so the bully takes advantage of that and does not stop. Everyone deserves to be treated fairly and no one should have to go through that! _________ None None My reaction to Kanye’s comments is that of disgust and disregard  I agree with the widespread denunciation. Celebrities’ personal opinions  depending on the topic  do not necessarily influence my opinion of their work  but they do influence my support of them. I’ve stopped listening to many artists because of what they’ve said and what they’ve done regardless of my initial positive feelings about their work. I don’t want to endorse a person who espouses hateful views or plain ignorance. I don’t think separating the art from the artist applies to modern public figures who should understand the significance of their comments and actions. It’s easy for people like Mr. Leibovitz to minimize Kanye’s rhetoric as a mere opinion. But while some have the privilege of ignoring politics  others are affected daily by its consequences  which is why I don’t understand how the endorsement of a man with staunch support from white supremacists should be tolerated and overlooked as simply a different viewpoint. This “free-thinking” is dangerous because it normalizes the racism Kanye has internalized and gives credibility to those who believe in these ideas. People shouldn’t be given a pass because others perceive them as creative and insightful  Kanye’s pseudo-intellectual comments  especially as a “proud non-reader of books ” are the direct opposite of insight  and they should be held accountable  especially when their “missteps” aren’t actually mistakes but intentional choices they make. None Kanye West has never been the kind of person to withhold what he thinks from the media because it would cause controversy. In the recent TMZ interview that he took part in  he made the comment that looking back now after hundreds of years “slavery is a choice” which immediately caused outrage. Although his comments are unpopular in the public eye  in my opinion it should not harbor an effect on the enjoyment of his musical or fashion endeavors. West has the right to say what he believes and for people to attempt to boycott his music and to cause such an uproar because of the fact that he is in the public eye. I enjoy West’s music separate from whether I agree or disagree with his political or other public views. One of the things that makes Kanye the great artist that he is  is his edge and refusal to keep with the norm. He is entitled to his opinion and in my opinion for Kanye to say something of this nature is not extremely surprising. None Although I was surprised by what Kanye West said during his interview  I like hearing what celebrities have to say about topics that don’t have anything to do with their profession. You never know what they are gonna say. Kanye is a musician and an entertainer. I have never unfollowed a celebrity on social media because of their political views. If their beliefs influence their work  I would still follow them. It’s part of who they are. After listening to Kanye’s interview on TMZ  it made me realize that even though Kanye’s comments on slavery were very shocking  he has the right to express his feelings. I understand that some people were offended by what he said. He is famous and he has a lot of influence  but people have the right to criticism him  unfollow him or to boycott his products and music if they want. Freedom of expression is a right of all Americans. Kanye said in his interview that he admires Trump because he proved that anything is possible in America. I can understand how Kanye can relate to Trump as an outsider. Kanye’s interview shows how important it is to have conversations about controversial issues. Everyone has their own opinions  no matter how different they are  we should listen so that we can understand where people are coming from even if we don’t agree with them. Artists and people need to be free to express themselves  it’s one of the things that makes America great  even if we disagree with what they say. None Personally  I’m glad that Kanye West is sharing his opinion. The right to free expression is everyone’s and Kanye is not exempt. The public response was unfair  having an unpopular opinion does not make someone crazy  but  the right is entitled to their opinion as well. It’s human nature to put people in boxes. As Mr. West states in his TMZ interview  he is an artist  a musician  and a black person  but his opinions do not have to align with other members of that group. It is not his responsibility to represent anyone besides himself and his company. The most human thing that Kanye or any artist can do is express their unique perspective.A celebrities’ personal beliefs — their political leanings  philosophical stances  perspectives on the world and their causes  should not be considered when deciding the quality of their work. Simultaneously  artist’s work should not be independent of who they are. If you don’t like what someone stands for  then go find other entertainers. I would never delete a celebrities social media or not watch their performances because their opinions don’t align with mine. I believe it is important to interact with and receive the opinions of people who you don’t agree with. People’s personal beliefs have never changed my feelings about their work. I agree with Mr. Leibowitz’s statement because free expression is a right of all americans. None When people say that Kanye is in the “Sunken Place” I honestly found it as a joke but now I’m starting to think this statement is true. I feel  as many others do  that he’s only doing this because he has music coming out. Kanye is known for acting a fool when he has something coming out so that it brings him a much attention. But as far as his very surprising remarks on slavery  I am honestly extremely hurt  taken back  and disgust. Being imprisoned is not a choose. We have to keep in mind that many of those slaves made tough decisions like taking their lives and risking running away  killing masters  and rebelling. So the statement about choosing to to be slaves and being mental imprisoned was very reckless. None After returning from his one year mental cool down  Kanye West has returned to the public eye in a very thought provoking way. Personally I believe that Mr. West’s comments could offend many people  but I can’t say I feel personally attacked by his ideals. He believes the words he is speaking and he is entitled to his opinion. The public can comment on his views but I believe that nobody should be attempting to conform him because of the influence he holds over people. Kanye West has millions of fans that will listen to what he says but people who challenge his views have no right to say he shouldn’t believe what he wants. West is challenging the social norm and he doesn’t deserve to be treated poorly based off his beliefs  no person does. None Just like every other person  Kanye is entitled to his own opinion  but when you’re in a position of status or power  you have to be conscious of the impact of your words. In regards to Mr. West showing his support for Trump  although I do not support Trump in any way  that is his choice and option to do so. However when stating that 400 years of slavery was a choice  there was a clear lack of thought behind what he was saying. He completely dismissed the mental and physical brutality of slavery and the repercussions of it against black people throughout history: from Jim Crow era to police brutality. I wouldn’t have had as big of a problem with it if Kanye offered an explanation  but his statement seemed as if there was little or no thought to back it up. Kanye is a great artist that many look up to  however he has to realize that what he says has an effect on everyone.In general for me  an artist’s work and beliefs go hand in hand. If something they support goes against what I stand for morally  I can not continue to support them  because at the end of the day there are plenty of artists and musicians that I can enjoy. That doesn’t mean they themselves are a bad person or their work is bad  but it would be hypocritical for me to say one thing  while supporting artists with morals that do not align with my own. None Kanye West is notorious for speaking out against the norm and having an abstract point of view. After listening to Kanye’s interview  I was intrigued by his mindset and the way he views big political matters. Kanye was recently seen wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat and when asked about it  he replied “It was just what I was feeling that day.” He then said how he likes Trump and how he was considered an outsider in the presidential campaign and ended up becoming president. Kanye enjoyed the fact that an “outsider infiltrated” and won the election. Kanye  unlike many other rappers  likes Trump and is intrigued by the way he handles things. Kanye also likes Trump because of how he uses his platform to speak directly to the people and how the people have no fear in speaking back. Kanye believes that Trump has allowed Americans to speak out and feel comfortable doing so. _________ None None Goodbye May the rain splash against your umbrella May they sit like dew drops or slither away May the rain caress our cheeks? But the drops on our cheeks aren’t rain  Are they? Please let me carry your luggage for you May you find happiness above the clouds The people around us hustle along The chaos that surrounds use We reach security  I can’t go further The last time these eyes see yours The ticket stamped and I’m given one last glance A wave of a hand and a bittersweet smile You’re going to better and brighter places  Far away from me Resting on my nightstand A journal  your journal You’ve forgotten it You’d never let me read it It stays with me  daring me to explore your thoughts But I mustn’t  I can’t break your trust I can’t break what’s already broken And the drops on my cheeks aren’t rain  Are they? None At different locations on this giant green rock  there are personal items being lost. They’re carried from A to B  seeing the world from low and high  in wallets and bags. Their needs not thought about by their owners. Because they’re not living  they dont have feelings  right? Although these seem like lost items  they are just trying to go on their own journey. A book  filled with personal secrets or a schedule wants to read stories. A wet umbrella after a spring storm wants to feel the warm sun. A ticket  going somewhere far or near wants to stay put. And a suitcase  seeing hundreds of faces everyday and then being packed away  when it really wants to see the world. Maybe these items go missing on purpose  so they can be on their own. To be free of boundaries and the “stereotypes” of non living items. The ticket drifts out of a hand  the book drops out of a bag  the umbrella is left at a rest stop 30 miles up the road  and the suitcase is left alone in a florida airport. This is where their story begins. None Eggsy was going on a trip  had his luggage packed  his identifying book ready  his sword and shield umbrella  and his suitcase with his weapons  passports  and other spy stuff ready to go  all he needed was his train ticket to get to San Francisco by 9:00 and he could leave. He went to the booth  got his ticket  and left everything in his bunk room on the train to go get a drink and find out more about the train’s occupants  only to get back to find all his spy stuff  book  suitcase  and umbrella stewed all over the floor with a ripped up ticket that said  “You’re on the wrong train.” None Heading out from LA for a weekend of fun with friends in San Fransisco  Jim had his necessary travel items packed in his blue carry-on rolling bag  his leather bound diary  rainbow colored umbrella for those unexpected January rain showers  toiletries and a few items he would want to wear. At 5:07 he boarded the train and took his window seat. Comfortable and relaxed  sipping on his hot take-out coffee  he looked out as the the train started to roll out of the station. With anticipation for the upcoming concert Jim took out his ticket for the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium  only to see something was not right. It was the date. His ticket read: “Saturday  January 12  2018  8:00”. Suddenly he panicked because today was Friday January 12  2018. Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,students and education

This seems like something that this publisher has already used  but if it hasn’t been used yet I’d like to recommend seeing how it goes. “Can you hate what an artist  what they stand for  or what they believe in  but still enjoy what they create?” This topic seems like it would have been covered during the Harvey Weinstein controversy  but I recently saw something that made me think of it. Kanye West posted on his Twitter that he supports Donald Trump. Not even a day later  he had lost 10 million of his followers. It made me think of how fickle some people are  and what they actually like about certain artists. None None None It runs for 10 weeks  from June 15 to Aug. 24  and all you have to do to enter is just answer the question  “What interested you most in The Times this week?” None Now  enjoy this week’s selection. Please note: All student comments have been lightly edited for length  but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted. _________ None None School isn’t the place for self-expression  but it should be. Teachers often tell students that they should show their personality in their work  but then deem it “unprofessional” or “distracting” - how is that supposed to encourage us? Kids and teenagers alike need to express themselves to their peers  their teachers  and their communities  especially when they aren’t accepted at home. A school is not only a place for learning facts - it’s a place to learn more about yourself and about how you relate to the world around you while being supported by people who care (why else would a teacher choose that job?). Allowing kids to learn these skills and supporting them as they do so yields adults who know how to bring passion into their lives - even if they have a 9-5 job they’d love to quit. Of course there are teachers who love to see kids grow and figure out how to be themselves in a safe  joyful way  but so often our need to meet a certain standard or rubric leads us to abandon our individuality. It’s a sad world if the push for perfection quashes the vibrancy of self-expression. Instead  we should let this drive for self-improvement be enhanced by our individuality to create a richer  happier world. None In school  many students feel detached from their studies. I hear complaints all around me about how boring assignments are and how much students dislike memorizing facts about distant topics. We are constantly bombarded with work that is not relatable to our interests and is very structured. However  some assignments are more open-ended  and I think that these are the pieces of work that students can learn the most from. Depending on the topic of work  certain classes allow for projects in which students can choose what they would like to study and then apply the information from the class to their own personal interests. When these assignments are given  it is much more common for students to be truly interested and invested in their work. While I rarely hear fellow students gushing excitedly about the assignment that every single person had to complete in the same way  when delving into something that they actually care about  people tend to be more excited about their learning. None I feel that school shuts down self-expression  by dress coding people for wearing things they are comfortable or confident in  by making you do everything exactly the way the teacher wants it or else getting a bad grade  judging your intelligence on questions that have one exact answer that the teacher is looking for. At my school i don’t have a chance to ever express my culture  my family  or my personality. The only time at my school that i get to express my experiences and ideas are in my AP classes  in my AP classes i feel as though the teachers care more and they don’t just ask questions with one answer  i feel like those teachers are genuinely trying to help me learn  understand and voice my opinions not just get their paycheck  and leave. None Personally I do not consider school to be a place where I find myself flourishing on a personal level. The person I am is not really how I am at school at all. I feel like this is the case for most high school students as well. Aside from my personal friends at school  my peers don’t really have a true glimpse at how I am as a person.This may be due to the lack of encouragement in bringing your personal lives to the school environment. ...We learn so much throughout the course of our four years in high school  but only a small portion of that will be actually useful in the future. We are not encouraged to find ourselves or express as people while in school. It is easy to start feeling like a number rather than a person sometimes  and thats the sad truth of it all. None I believe that while the idea of school itself isn’t exactly a place for self-expression  schools often can be a place for self-expression  if students choose to express themselves. I attend Danvers High School  where  like most public high schools  there is not a strict or severe dress code  enabling the students to express themselves through what clothing they choose to wear. Furthermore  students can express themselves in their classes when participating in creative assignments  we are occasionally allowed to relate our work back to a subject we are interested in  as I wrote an argument in my AP English class discussing the pros and cons of Joe Montana and Tom Brady. Additionally  students are allowed to express themselves with the people they choose to spend time with  and the people they are associated with. My school has a large amount of clubs and sports teams that students may participate on  and in choosing what sport they play or what club they are a member of  students are expressing their interests and who they are as a person. None My home is where I feel best able to express myself. There  I am surrounded by family  I know we have seen all of each other’s sides: the good  the bad  and the ugly. We may tease each other  but we are always accepting of one another no mater how crazy we are. We have grown up together and they have had my back through everything. My family has seen me at two in the morning bouncing all over the walls and seen me at 6 in the morning looking completely dead as i get ready for school. They already know how I act and look in most situations and nothing surprises them anymore. My family has been there for everything and I know that no matter what  they will always be there. I convey my thoughts  questions  ideas  and emotions very loudly at home and chaotic. I know that my family is the same and we may seem crazy and out of control to anyone outsider lolking in  but we get each other and we like it that way. None In my opinion  I do not feel like I have had the freedom to express myself at school as I will want to  due to many factors. First  you as student can easily get judged by others even by teachers when you do not agree with their ideas and opinions. Second  when you try to express your opinions  emotions or feelings  there is always someone against it. Most of the times  I do feel like our ideas are not appreciated in school  they may ask our opinions but we are not going to see changes due to our ideas. We haven’t had freedom to express our personalities  culture  and ideas at school because we are forced to a certain way of writing  and as the article says  “somewhere along the way  these young people were told by teachers that who they are in their writing ought to be divorced from who they are on their phones ” (paragraph 3). Students are not only someone else in their writing  but at some point even prohibited to use the word “I” in essays  lacking the opportunity to express themselves. Although most classes don’t give students the opportunity to express themselves  the only class that have fully given me as a student the opportunity to express not only my ideas and opinions but also my culture has been Freshaman Composition class taught by Mrs. Martin. None I only feel that my personality  culture  family  experiences  and ideas are appreciated in journalism. We have many opportunities to write about things we like and express ourselves in creative formats. Such as  the editorials we are writing and the bellringers we do everyday. In other classes like reading we could instead of having essays with prompts we could write about our family and culture and maybe even have an open discussion about topics and issues going on in our community. None In English class we sometimes are asked about our feelings in the moment or about a topic and at times we are asked a tricky question and have to give our best answer. This just gives us a chance to write our opinion and feelings. We are also asked to just write about what happened over the weekend or vacation so it emerges in a school work quite enough. I personally like writing about personal and my own life. None School is where the majority of kids spend their days. To me  I feel like school is a place for self-expression. I say this because of the different races  culture  and language thats distributed throughout the school. The overall diversity that a school house contains is what makes it full of expression. After reading the article  I can say that I was somewhat able to question and articulate “devotions  frustrations  little triumphs  and large peculiarities” because they all deal with self-expression and how I carry myself. I could say that one-fourth of what I care about outside of school does involve inside of school because I tend to lean more on what I know from the outside to learn more about on the inside. All in all  expression and school was rebooted in my mind. None As a noobie teacher who got picked to teach the other English teachers’ least favorite class  college prep writing  I often feel pressed to quelch creative expression for the sake of formal academic writing. Though my heart is in creative nonfiction  prose  and countless genres of fiction  I am required to create curriculum that teaches all students  from the potential engineer  to nurses  to artists  how to communicate persuasively and effectively in writing. With the common core standards and emphasis on reading nonfiction and writing persuasively  I always get nervous about seeing too many “I” statements in the papers I receive. It’s a hard balance to teach how to put your unique imprint on an academic piece  but I know it can be done. Most of today’s everyday readers aren’t reading heavily structured academic pieces (unless they’re in school studying specialized knowledge)  they’re reading the op ed columns  arguments in the comments  and articles about topics they are interested in. Not just that  they’re looking for writing that catches their attention and keeps it. I’m not setting my students up for success to be such writers if I don’t allow them some creative self-expression  so Mr. Kolb’s points are refreshing and affirming. At the same time  I have to teach students how to read and write with a critical eye so we can have smart citizens who don’t believe or reproduce misinformation. It’s a hard balance because “critical” often feels like the enemy of “creative.” _________ None None I have a problem with not throwing things away  that stays the same whether it’s scraps of paper and bits of trash  or the random postcards I’ve gathered through the years. My floor is covered in clothes  mostly clean  so I can access them fast and easy when getting ready for school! (This doesn’t happen  it’s still somehow my excuse for the mess.) And everywhere  there are books. In to be read piles  favorite or comfort book piles  new and no home piles  musician biography piles  the classics pile. You name it. Not to mention the two bookshelves  also smothered with books. They are the most consistent items in my room  because when I moved throughout my childhood it was always something to give my new room  the homey feel I wanted in a new place. My books are from my youngest years  all the way up to the three books I bought last week. They are all around the house  because I refuse to let any of them go  but the special ones live in my room. Some have flowers from England  or dandelions from Texas  some have handmade bookmarks  or literal lost puzzle pieces  even poems and thoughts from specific moments of my life to future me. These books bear the scars of my childhood. They are battered  worn  and loved. So I think if I had to pick any item in my room to describe my life and my strengths it would be all of my books collectively. They are genuinely a part of my past  present  and future self  and it’s evident when looking at them. None Last month  I thought it was a good idea to go through my room. My findings were very interesting as I found: old clothes  23 Birthday Cards  and other hoarding materials. The garbage can outside was filled all the way to the top with junk. I started to realize that the stuff I didn’t throw away was important to me. I found a letter I wrote to myself in 6th grade. I also found a Birthday card that my aunt wrote  which she lives in Colorado. That meant a lot because I don’t get to see her a lot. Finding these treasures  made me remember these exact moments. Similar to the author  I didn’t throw these away. I kept them in a box  which is now in my closet. Including my middle school awards  first pair of cleats  and etc. As I head into the future  I will cherish these memories. By doing this I will fix my mistakes  and hold onto my strengths. Holding onto these maintains who I am. None My room is a direct reflection of the chaos happening in my mind around the clock. Sometimes  I’ll uncover something intriguing  but typically  it just get shoved into the background without much consideration. Perhaps an old shirt in the corner  representing a more sane time in my life  a sequenced dress representing a time I was less careful and more open to the 12 A.M social scenes... You know... the all too common  annoying teenage problems which I can’t seem to shake quite yet.... Truth be told  looking at the surface of clothes which hang from every orifice in my room  I could dispose of 3/4 of the things.... Oh  but not my cherry red lipstick and the slightly cracked picture of my family... (Don’t ask about the crack... I haven’t quite figured it out just yet). None If somebody wants to get to know me  all they need to do is to come inside my room. Over the past few months  I have gone through all of my belongings  and have thrown the junk away while keeping all the things that actually matter. Awards from Elementary school for being in the art show  toss  my old dance shoes  into the trash. But other objects that matter  my old American Girl dolls  post cards from a trip to Greece and aged photos  are some of the things that I want to carry into the future. I have crafted my room to paint a complete picture of who I am. That way  when I am older and grown up  I will have a lot of reminiscing to do when I come back to my childhood bedroom. None Recently I’ve excavated my room finding much of the norm: too many pointe shoes to count  some random clothes I would never consider wearing today  and just a ton of junk. I filled two whole trash bags with junk. Not every thing was junk though. I found a letter I wrote to myself about hating my mom  a birthday card I wrote for someone in third grade but never gave to them  and a violin from my classical music era. These types of items bring me to another time like the author of the essay. I can almost fathom exactly how I felt at that moment just by seeing a remnant from my past. There are things I would never consider throwing away. Things like my first pair of pointe shoes  my middle school graduation awards  or my art and map that covers the walls. These things are part of myself and my past that I would like to remember. While I evolve into a better person  I still want to hold onto the past and either remember my mistakes or my strengths. I don’t know if this hints to my destiny  but I want to retain my identity as I travel into the future. _________ None None I have never been afraid of classical music. Perhaps it’s because I’m a flutist  but I’ve never shied away from Tchaikovsky  I’ve never been skittish of the Goldberg Variations.It is a great tragedy when we think of classical music as being haughty  or the sort of music that only plays in art galleries. When we constrict concertos to being things that exist in certain parts of our lives  we miss out on the humanity of music. Let classical music bleed into the modern era. Let your heartbreaks align with the great crescendos of cellos. Let your life fall into a handful of 4/4 measures  and then  and perhaps only then  will you learn to appreciate music the way it was meant to be appreciated.The best way to watch a concert where classical music is being played is to simply not watch at all. Close your eyes. Let your mind wander as the orchestra carries you through major and minor  through tempos you can feel throughout your entire body. Don’t let yourself be intimidated. None It is sad to hear that people are intimidated by classical music.I would like to begin by saying that I have been playing the piano for a while and I can see where people might feel intimidated by a classical piece. In most classical pieces there isn’t a band or a producer  there are 50 or so musicians working together to produce a masterpiece to the ear. This is intimidation in its own right  most people don’t sit down with some friends and throw on The Four Seasons by Vivaldi. It is complex and full of life  to truly enjoy it you must listen to it live. But  where there is live music  there will be people. Here is where I can understand  I can’t tell you how many people will try to put themselves above everyone else by talking about “How splendid the crescendo was” or “How the staccato really gives the piece a unique sound” This stuff even annoys me  and I understand what it means. To someone just looking to enjoy some nice music  this can be a major turn off. I think this is the biggest issue for newcomers. There seems to be an obligation to say crescendo instead of  It Gets Louder. This negative stigma makes it seem like you must be well educated to enjoy music  this isn’t true. If you have ears  you can appreciate music  it’s that simple. None I’ve loved classical music since I first listened to it and to put it plainly  I can’t wrap my head around this “Classic music insecurity complex” because classic music in and of itself is a form of art. The symphonies are each like a vivid painting and the composer an artist. As for the second question  I would totally be willing to listen to a performance or piece due to the dedication of the composer or violinist etc  and the beauty that is classic music. There are times when I can’t appreciate music if I know what it was truly about or how it was created  or simply because I’ve listened to it way to many times. But on the contrary  the more I know about a certain song  on the matter of how it was made or it’s meaning  I can like it much more like Overture With Cannons (Yes  he actually had cannons at the performance) which was made by Tchaikovsky to commemorate Napoleon’s invasion of Russia  or Richard Wagner’s Ride of The Valkyries which reminds me of the iconic opening scene of ride of the Valkyries and many other parallel scenes. None I am a musician and I love and appreciate all music. I appreciate modern day music and symphonic pieces from the 1800’s. I know people seem to have CMI  the insecurity of not being able to fully understand the technical aspects of music but still are moved. I don’t think anyone should feel that way because yes the composer or artist have intentions with the ways they want you to feel but music is for everyone. Whether you are a musician or just a casual listener  it’s okay to have opinions about music in which you don’t know the full meaning.Classical style music will hopefully always be made so there is always time to have a great appreciation for it even if you don’t fully get it. None I have recently begun to listen to classical music. I think it is a very beautiful experience and I’m ashamed to say that I didn’t realize I had been intimidated by it until I read this article. Everything about classical music is bold and sophisticated: the volume  the tempo  even the words they use to describe their pieces such as “the work features a truncated development with chromatic modulations to distant keys and modally inflected motivic cells.” The Classical Music Insecurity Complex is what causes people to feel uncomfortable listening and or talking about this genre. You don’t have to know a thing about classical music to enjoy listening to it. It’s all about the way the music makes you feel when you listen to it and I hope that more people will one day be willing to branch out of their comfort zone and try listening to it. None MUSICOPHILIA: MUSIC & THE BRAIN Is one of the masterpieces of the late renowned neurologist  Oliver Sacks. To me it is his crowning glory. Sacks wrote that with the brain scans of the 80s and 90s  scientists were able to observe the activity in centers of the brain far more accurately than before. They discovered that music engages more brain activity than any other human area of study. In fact  he mentioned in an interview with Terry Gross in Fresh Air on NPR that if he had Einstein’s brain  it would look no different from any other brain. But if he took the brain of a professional musician  the impact of music on the brain results in highly visible changes in its structure  including the thickening of the corpus collossum that connects the two hemispheres of the brain and growth in the area of the brain where sound is processed  as well as other areas. Music and the brain inspire awe and wonderment. Just relax and enjoy it. Your brain will take care of the rest. Of course  if you wish to study  you can do that too. None I have always been exposed to classical music  art  and theater. Ever since I was in my mother’s womb  classical music has been part of my life. My interest and enjoyment of such art forms comes as a result of my exposure to such. This has allowed me to be more comfortable and interested in seeking an understanding of these mediums. In the end  it was my interactions with classical music  art  and theater that have further enhanced my enjoyment of them. I feel my experience is a great example for the claim made by Mr. Hoffman: “there’s no denying that the more we know about music  as with cooking or gardening or football  the more levels of enjoyment are available to us.” None Growing up  I would always listen to rap and r&b. If someone were to tell me to listen to classical music I would have probably laughed and wonder if they were serious. The people I was surrounded by influenced me to listen to music aside from classical music. In all I would say that I am intimidated by modern art and classical music but that all is from my roots and how I grew up. Reading this article did not change my opinion on classical music because I am so costumed to a specific type a music. I do not see myself attending a performance because I am simply not interested in it. However  I do agree with Hoffman when he said that the educational system have a part in “Classical Music Insecurity”. _________ None None I say that if cheerleading and gymnastics are considered a sport  that breakdancing should be too. Breakdancing is more than just dancing it targets your muscles and requires strength  just like every other sport. Breakdancing has it’s own world of battling and competitions which is why I think it shouldn’t be an olympic sport  but if it was that’d be pretty cool. None Break dancing should definitely be in the Olympics  it takes tons of practice like everything else  uses a lot of concentration  and takes a lot of work. It would also add a little more “spice” to the Olympics. I’d also like to see rock climbing as an Olympic sport  it’s so different and people don’t even think about it but it takes the same amount of work  pressure  concentration  and practice if not more. None Taking an art like dancing to the Olympics is something I would not watch. To me dancing is a way to express myself when I am happy or eating really good food. Watching people show off their dancing skills might be cool for the next person but for me it’s something that has a deeper meaning than competition. None I personally do not think breakdancing should be an Olympic Sport. There has to be a point where you draw the line. The article went on to talk about some things such as a rubik’s cube competition or hacky sack which just seems plain out absurd to me. While these activities may take a extensive amount of time and dedication I do not perceive the people competing in these competitions as athletes. Honestly I think for the IOC to open up the Olympics to new competitions  it ruins the integrity of the Olympic Games. Breakdancing has no place in the Olympics until it is further established. Serouj Aprahamian (a breakdancer) even petitioned that the IOC who was known for ballroom dancing would have no idea how to run a breakdancing competition. Another thing I feel like that is crucial when determining whether a new sport should be introduced to the Olympic Games is “is there room for it?”. While there are currently 42 summer sports there are only 15 winter sports. One sport that I enjoy playing and watching is baseball. While it is not recognized as an Olympic game I am completely fine with it as there is the World Baseball Classic which is also held every four years. While the article may have jokingly mentioned Donkey Kong as a potential Olympic event I do see gaming being at least questioned as whether it should be a Olympic event or not. I play plenty of video games myself but rather than introducing esports into the Olympics they should instead create an E-Olympics. _________ None None When I finished reading both articles  I was left surprised and skeptical that there might be a scientific correlation to us being friends. Although this might be true  friendships develop over time. You don’t instantly become good friends with someone  it takes a while. Some of my friends I’ve known for years but haven’t started actually being friends with until this year. Friendships are not entirely dependent on sharing extremely similar personalities. I’m a quiet liberal who isn’t the most social person on the planet while a lot of my friends are very talkative conservatives who are incredibly social. It doesn’t matter. We’re friends because we’re different  because if we were all similar it would be like talking to yourself all of the time and that would become maddening. None I happen to go from friend to friend  not having a permanent group. However  the people I happen to be friends with always have characteristics similar to my own. Humor  for one  is a driving factor in who I look to seek companionship from. I believe it’s important to surround yourself with different opinions  so you won’t shroud yourself in a bubble  and so you can grow as a person. I am not very surprised to see a scientific correlation  because there must be some reason as to why I am drawn to specific people  specifically those of the opposite gender who are around my age and have similar but not exactly the same socioeconomic conditions. None My friends and I are very alike in a way of being indecisive and innocent. Also  we all are Asians  sophomores  and short we have almost same heights. We are interested in Asian food and culture. Since I have friends who are very similar to me in terms of personality  interests  appearance  and educational level  I have expected that a person’s friends would be similar to the person in personality or backgrounds  but I never knew that friends have similar brain activities. I thought that way because we became friends after some time we met for the first time  I don’t think we really had any instant chemistry with my best friends. I don’t remember why  but we started having lunches together at some point. Then  we somehow continued our awkward conversations and found out what we have in common. The advantage of having similar friends is that we could keep talking constantly about many topics because we usually talk about what we are all interested in and knowledgeable about. However  having similar friends does not help very much about extending my knowledge or views because I wouldn’t get to hear different perspectives. On the other hand  I could learn a lot from friends who are not similar to me  but I often feel overwhelmed when they explain so much information to me  and I don’t understand most of their explanation. None I tend to see patterns with my closest friends with the way we behave  the way we speak  our facial expressions and mannerisms  but this is all after we have been very close for a while. I have a very large and diverse friend group but one commonality that I know we all share is determination and drive to succeed and similar mentalities when it comes to school and sports alike. The fact that my friends and I are so alike in this way causes us to push each other to be our best selves  instead of allowing each other to just be good. However  sometimes this becomes more of a competition than motivation. While not all of my friends are my best friend  the people that I consider my best friends are the least like me. They were easy to connect with and we didn’t judge each other upon first meeting. We were able to bond right away. None Me and my friends are similar  I wouldn’t use the word alike. Being exactly like your friends is boring  because eventually you learn their every move. My friends and I don’t always see eye to eye on everything but for the most part we have the same tastes in music and enjoy the same activities. No two friends should be exactly alike or enjoy EVERYTHING together  friends argue and disagree all the time. Without our differences we’d all be... Ordinary. None I share the same core values with all of my friends. What brings us together is our overall trust that we have with each other  and an understanding that goes beyond simple things. We all value honesty  kindness  grades and most of all loyalty. While at the center  we all very much similar  there is little overlap in our personalities and interests. Everybody in my group has different things that they are involved in. That is what makes us interesting. If everybody was the same  the world would be a very boring place. Some of my friends like sports  others art and writing. But no matter how different we are  what really matters is that we all share a mutual understanding  and have similar values above all else. _________ None None What my parents want is what’s best for me. It’s what they’ve always wanted. I’ve never had to rebel against my parents because we want the same things. I long to be a doctor when I grow up  and they support me (maybe it’s because they’re doctors too). Being half-asian  I know the struggles that the author points out  but I do realize that my parents have high expectations not because of my background  but because of me. It sounds like the author had numerous toxic fights with her parents  which is not the case in my family. My parents only push me to do what they know I can do  although I know this is not the case with other families. I talk to my parents about my future knowing that they know more than I do. I want to go into the same field as them  so I ask if they could do it over again  what profession would they go into. I think I am more like my dad  but I can relate to my mom too. Seeing the differences between my family and the author’s family widens my perspective about American expectations. I think that as long as a child knows that their parents want what’s best for them  it’s easier for both sides to understand each other. I love and trust my parents  and we have a great relationship because of their expectations. I am grateful that they are open about my accomplishments and decisions. It’s important to find a balance between expectations and open-mindedness. None Parents  hopefully  want the best for their child. However  what the parent wants may not be what child wants or even what the child needs. Personally  I fall in between rebelling and conforming. I try not to do anything that would horribly upset them  but I also won’t back down. There are some things about me that are just part of who I am  whether or not parents want to accept it. Most of my choices do upset them  and definitely confuse them  and most of that has to do with the fact that what is more widely accepted today by the world was not what was widely accepted for the majority of their lives. These decisions do affect my relationship quite a bit  and have since caused a lot of stress and strife. But in the end  it is my life. I’m not interested in breaking laws or hurting anyone  I just want to be myself. None My parents want me to do something with my life that is my choice  but there is one contender: I must be able to support myself. After college  I must be able to live on my own and maintain a job. I have to major in something that has great job prospects  so I can go out into the real world. I am confident that whatever career I choose  my parents will support me. Their ultimate wish is that I pursue a career in something that I am passionate about. I am going to follow my parents guidance when it comes time to pick a major  because the last thing I want is to be out of college  and my parents are saying “I told you so.” None Truth be told  my parents who I love dearly are somewhat paradoxical characters. The younger I was  the more freedom I had when it came to my future. Dentist one day  president of the United States the next. I hate to call it a ‘phase’ because it only accredits my parents more but sure  I’ll give it to them this time. Despite my diabolical and somewhat ourageous aspirations considering their insurmountable odds  my parents went along with it. Perhaps  even encouraged it. However  upon my graceful induction into what I then called  ‘twelve-teen’  their unhinged enthusiasm saw an unexpected pullback. And man did I notice. Nowadays  just a year away from college  from the sidelines they lovingly attempt to micromanage all aspects of my life and steer me away from the inevitable horrors which await me. How do we engage in these deep  analytical  thought-provoking conservations about my future? For now  there is nothing a good movie can’t fix. None Some of my decisions are way off of my parents wishes and decisions. Both of my parents are lawyers and both of my grandfathers are lawyers. My dad  I believe  would like my siblings or I to take over one of the families businesses. I would like to be an ophthalmologist  which is my dream job. My parents agree with me on that  but they sometimes disagree with me on the little things. All in all  my parents love me very much. They respect me and my decisions too  even if my decisions are not what they want for me. Others should confront their parents  and say they are set on this particular thing. If not  you could be forced and pushed into a direction that you wouldn’t want to be or do with your life. None For as long as I can remember  I have loved plans. I like knowing definitively what I’m going to do  when I’m going to do it  and where. The plans changed as I grew up - when I was eleven  I wanted to be a veterinarian  and then I realized I’d have to know everything about every animal. When I was fifteen  I wanted to be a barn manager  and then I realized I’d make next to nothing. Now  I’m seventeen  and I want to be an OT and live in New York City. That’ll probably change  as plans always do. But for now  I’m happy. My mom was the one who pointed out the holes in my plans. Pointed out salaries and the things an average eleven or thirteen-year-old will forget. Pointed out the sharp edge of reality when my head was in the clouds. My mom taught me compassion and empathy  and I took those lessons and ran with them  and now I hope my life revolves around those things. She is hardly ever confused or angry about decisions I make - it was hard for me to relate to kids who panicked over flunking tests because their parents would “kill them”. None Personally  I am conforming to my parents. Your parents are the ones that you live with until you go off to college. They provide a roof over your head and food on the table. Your parents pay for college and teach you valuable life lessons. I am very respectful towards my parents at all times. As for the article  when Ms. Kuo writes “Invite your parents into the conversation. Let them believe they are helping to guide you. Offer information that might persuade them. Mention older people whom you have consulted  spelling out their paths” I fully agree with her. Communicating and interacting with your parents is something that I have always done. I know many teenagers that basically ignore their parents. I believe that is very disrespectful  developing a weak relationship between kids and their parents. _________ None None In my neighborhood  the downtown area acts as a gathering place for the community. After school  students from both middle schools flock to the center of town. Lines are formed outside of the local drug store where penny candy is sold  starbucks  the arcade and pizza restaurants where slices can be bought for under 2 bucks. The restaurants that line our streets are great for families too  along with the large park situated in the middle of town. It is the downtown area that really makes our community what it is. I am so grateful for it  and although I may take this luxury for granted  I truly am amazed at how wonderful it feels like to live in a neighborhood with an excellent downtown area. None It my hometown  the place where all my friends still meet up at is the movie theater. Whenever a movie that we all want to see is playing  we schedule a time and go to see it. Other than that though  we never really hang out outside of school. I feel like online communication has diminished the amount of places such as these. I can easily see how waffle house would be a good meeting place for people to gather. The only bad part about waffle house is that there are none in the Northeast. It’s such a great place to be with family and friends. _________ None None As of now  I do not relate to anything that Mr. Yagoda does but do relate to the ideas he addresses. I think the reason people may have these tendencies because in today’s age  everyone is competitive  and  being competitive myself in life  realize it make sense to relate it to a video game. My “small triumphs” consist of getting better grades than a friend on a test or beating someone in a race or lifting more than someone. I am not surprised at the extent to which Mr. Yagoda “gamifys” his everyday life  because  while I do not relate it to games  I do compete with those around me and set goals in the same way. None I do identify with the habits and behaviors that Yagoda describes. It’s possible people do this to have fun with life  and look at it like a level in a game. Sometimes when I’m in the car I’ll imagine something that happens around me in the buildings or fields I see. None I see where Mr. Yogoda is coming from in his article. Many people plan to or even carry through with mapping out their days or even weeks so that they stay on track. example is some families make a “Week Meal Menu” 1.) so they know what each day of the week they are eating and 2.) so they can but just things on their list from the grocery store to make those meals and not buy extra items they don’t need. None I personally do not identify myself with the habits and behaviors she describes. By “Gamify” she means by tracking numbers of any sort. such as your weight gain  your electric bill  and your grades for school. The only thing I really tend to “Gamify” is my school grades. Because if I ‘Gamify” everything else it would become a hassle of time and would become an energy drainer. None By “gamifying life ” once remedial tasks  like going to CVS or taking a shower become adventures. Numbers are a way to enhance reality  adding excitement to places that need them most. I can identify with Mr. Yagoda’s plight  because I do the same on an almost daily basis. When I am in school  I often create a hand writing competition between my right and left hands. Considering that I am a righty  that hand always wins  but nevertheless I still like to keep score. In my head I play geography trivia with myself  thinking of a random country than trying to say the capital. Believe me  it makes those boring moments go by in a heartbeat. If it was for the games that I play with myself  life would be a lot less fun. They are not just a way to pass time  but to enrich it. None Ever since I was little I have hated being bored in the car. Considering my family takes many a road trip  I started pretending my hand was on an obstacle course. I would “jump” and ‘run” on telephone lines  and have to blink in between every white line on the road. It would keep me occupied for a while  but eventually I’d get bored and want to stop  but I never could! I’d get this strong and really strange feeling that if I didn’t finish the game my character would die. Which manifested itself into a weird game I couldn’t win. Obviously this isn’t the same as making weight loss a game  or turning a CVS into a battleground  but I’m saying I understand the fascination and innate desire for seemingly pointless or boring journeys to have a purpose. Winning and losing are feelings that create drive  to achieve or avoid and I don’t think it’s strange to live by that even in the most simple tasks. _________ None None I think every procrastinator believes they are the worst procrastinator  which is exactly how I feel. My procrastination habits were once a thing that left me to complete my work in a spur of creativity  whenever the moment felt right. But it’s gotten to the point where I sit and I wait for some creative idea to hit  it never comes  and me being so determined to do my best  I just don’t do it. Or when it comes to studying which requires no creativity  I feel the need to wait for panic to set in to motivate me. But usually my panic becomes so overwhelming I ignore it like I ignore the looming world war. There have been multiple projects though  that I have done the night before involving some artistic theme that were (not to brag  but I’m going to brag) some of the best in the class. Which doesn’t help me in truth because then I fool myself into believing procrastination will always benefit me. Which I know isn’t true but I still somehow stand by that fact. So maybe my procrastination habits will destroy my academic life and my future to come  but I’ll cross that bridge when I come to it. None Most of the time I would said I feel myself as a pre-crastinator  I hate when I have to finish any task and I cannot do it for sort of reason  in my personal opinion procrastinate a task is a waste of the time. If I finish something  I believe I can enjoy the free time that I have without any worries  or also i can start a new task without have to think in the other one. However after read this article its make me think in a different way. I never though procrastination could be very helpful when you are planning about to be creative. None I am something in between. Sometimes when I have time  I decide to do the work early  but when my friends call me  I decide to procrastinate a little bit just to have fun. Procrastinating makes us reduce stress. However  procrastination is in theory bad  because we leave our work to the end. Most of the time we do not end doing our duty. I feel so bad with my habits because I do not have too enough time to do my personal things  for example going out with friends  enjoying with my family or exercising. I only think about work and study. I think that I have to change my habits and create a little space for myself. Postpone a project to the last minute does not make a better job because you have less time to research and to correct errors. In my experience  it is better to do our duty in the beginning than procrastinate. If you do not do well and have many errors one project that is evaluated in thousands dollars  may be devalued to only hundreds of dollars. None I have always been a procrastinator and it seems a problem I’m never going to solve. It all started back in the 4th grade with Mrs. McCullough. I had been assigned my first big project  the notorious Science Fair Project. Not really knowing how much time it would take  I waited and waited until the night before it was due. I stayed up ’til 1 or 2 in the morning  which was far past my 7:30 bedtime. Little did I know that this would be the routine for every project and test for the rest of my school career. I’ve tried many times to break this habit  yet I can’t. The best I’ve done is a temporary fix that lasted for about a couple of weeks. New Years Resolutions  words for the year  and far in advance planning hasn’t done the trick. Now  procrastination doesn’t mean all I’ve gotten is bad grades. In fact  that science fair project was picked 3rd in my school and was chosen to compete at the county level. In reality  I got away with procrastination all through elementary and middle school. This is the first year procrastination has really kicked me in the butt. Like my mom has told me on numerous occasions  “The work is only going to get harder and harder and this habit isn’t going to work.” I should’ve listened a long time ago and I probably wouldn’t be sitting with a “B” average in AP World or staying up tonight to finish multiple assignments. I know something has got to change or my dreams of making it to a big-time college will be gone. Eventually I’ll figure it out  right? None I am also a procrastinator. Procrastinating is often seen as a negative thing. I  on the other hand  see it very differently. I believe that I perform my best when I work under the pressure of a time constraint. From studying last minute  things tend to stay fresh in my brain allowing me to remember things better. When I study or do my homework without procrastinating I often find myself daydreaming or getting distracted to easily. Procrastinating has gotten me this far in school so I might as well keep it going. None It could be two in the morning and I’ll still find an excuse to not complete an essay due the next day. In fact  I’ll just put it aside and set an alarm for 5:00a.m. The sound goes off  blaring in my ears and the feeling of regret immediately settles in. I contemplate my life and all the horrible decisions I’ve made leading up to this misery  yet I always seem to be the most focused under pressure. Knowing the job needs to get done under a time constraint allows me to give my undivided attention to the task at hand  disregarding all distractions surrounding me. As much as I hate having to procrastinate  it has served me well all along. None I am certainly sure that I am a procrastinator. I often feel frustrated when getting close to a deadline  because I had wasted time in meaningless actions just for entertainment or leisure without completing or even staring an important work or task. I do not think procrastinating has a bright side. Procrastination makes you waste valued time you could use performing an important task. Although  I had been in situations where my limited time caused by procrastinating force me to take risks. I would not take otherwise. As when I was  taking painting classes and very often my procrastination habits brought me to the deadline with an empty canvas. In those moments in order to finish my painting in one night  I experimented with different techniques that sometimes helped me not only finish faster my painting  but also leaving good results.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/education/learning/an-experts-view-sir-ken-robinson.html,An Expert’s View: Sir Ken Robinson Advertisement Supported by None Our new Learning sections will feature a question-and-answer segment with an education expert. For our first installment  we’ve chosen Sir Ken Robinson  a best-selling author and longtime advocate of transforming education. His latest book  “You  Your Child  and School ” was published in March by Viking. The following interview was edited and condensed. Your new book offers wide-ranging advice for parents as they try to manage their children’s education. If you had to choose one takeaway  what would it be? Parents have more power and more choices than they may realize in educating their children. Many parents are worried about how the world is changing and the uncertain futures their children face. Parents are especially anxious about education. They worry that there’s too much testing and competition  that the curriculum is too narrow  that their children are not treated as individuals and that schools are not cultivating their curiosity  confidence and creative talents. They worry about how many young people are being medicated for “learning problems.” They worry about the rising costs of college and whether their children will eventually find a job  whether or not they go to college. Often parents feel powerless to do anything about all of this. The good news is that a great many educators share these concerns and are also campaigning for change. While it’s reasonable to lay heavy responsibility on parents for charting the path of their children’s education  they are no match for the bureaucracy of any single school  let alone a state or federal Department of Education. How can parents expect to have any real impact? The challenges parents face and the options they have are naturally affected by their circumstances. Parents living in poor neighborhoods with limited resources face different challenges from those in wealthy suburbs with paid help. Some parents can pay for the education they want  most cannot. In general  they have three options: They can work for changes within the current system  particularly in their children’s own school  they can press for changes to the system  or they can educate their children outside the system. Whatever their circumstances  parents are not powerless and their voices must be heard. Is there one school system you think is doing things right? And if so  how? Governments everywhere are trying to improve education. For decades  the main strategies have been standardization  competition and incessant testing  especially in literacy  mathematics and science. It’s been a partial success at best and in many ways a dismal failure. The story in Finland is different. Finland is regularly at or near the top of international league tables in those disciplines but its success is much broader. Significantly  there is no mandated curriculum in Finland. Schools are encouraged to follow a broad curriculum that includes the arts  sciences  mathematics  languages  humanities and physical education. There is hardly any standardized testing. Finland invests heavily in the selection and training of teachers  and teaching is a high-status profession. The Finnish system is not perfect and it’s still evolving  but it’s succeeding against a wide range of measures  where many other systems fall tragically short  and it’s doing that by following a different path. You talk about the stress students are under these days. What’s the best way for a parent to ease that stress  while still keeping their students competitive in a very tough and demanding global environment? In the United States  more than eight out of 10 teenagers experience extreme or moderate stress during the school year  including headaches  loss of sleep  anger and irritability. The main causes include anxieties about academic performance  the pressures of testing  and parental pressures to excel at school and get into a good college. Many young people feel overscheduled with nearly every waking hour being assigned  plotted and planned with little time for just “being a kid.” Parents can help in three ways: by learning to recognize the signs of “toxic” stress  by easing the pressures at home through encouraging more downtime and by working collectively with the school to reduce some of the avoidable causes of stress  including the often excessive levels of homework and testing. You have been critical — as have many — of standardized testing. If you could change it  how would you do it differently? End it altogether? Change the format? Do it less often? And if the last  how do you ensure that students are learning what they need to know? There was a time when school students could expect to take a few tests each year. Now they face a seemingly endless steeplechase of tests  sometimes starting in kindergarten. High-stakes testing was meant to raise standards in education. Instead  it’s generated a dreary culture of incessant competition  which has soaked up billions of taxpayer dollars with no significant improvement in standards  causing enormous stress for teachers  children and their families. Constructive assessment is an essential part of high-quality education  and some forms of diagnostic testing can be helpful. The usual forms of high stakes testing are neither constructive nor essential. The proper purposes of assessment are to support and improve student learning and to provide an informative record of their achievements. There are many better ways to do this than through the barren rituals of bubble tests. What is your view of charter schools? Would you encourage or discourage their existence? Charter schools are independently operated public schools  which have freer rein than regular public schools in what they teach and how they are run. In themselves  they are neither better nor worse than ordinary public schools. Some are very successful  others less so. One argument for charter schools is that they can invigorate the public sector by spreading new practices. Some do and some don’t. Another is that they give parents more choice in education. The choice can be more apparent than real. All schools have limited spaces  and popular ones soon become oversubscribed. Either way  for most families  public schools are still their best opportunity in education. If you were the United States education secretary  what is the first thing you would do to change the American school system? What is education for? In my view  it is to enable all students to understand the world around them and the talents within them so that they can become fulfilled individuals and active  compassionate citizens. The proper role of government is to create the best conditions for that to happen. If I were secretary  I would encourage all schools to adopt a broad and balanced curriculum including languages  math  the arts  sciences  humanities and physical education  and develop nonstatutory guidelines and resources to support them. I would roll back the current testing requirements in favor of more informative approaches to assessment. I would support the comprehensive development of early-years education. I would institute a “soup to nuts” review of the selection  training and support of teachers. I would introduce incentives for creative partnerships between schools  families  cultural organizations and the private sector. In these and other ways  education can and must change — for all our sakes. Sir Ken Robinson is a widely recognized global leader in efforts to transform education. His online presentation for the prestigious TED conferences has drawn a record 50 million views. A professor emeritus at the University of Warwick in Britain  he advises governments  corporations  education systems and leading cultural organizations.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/education/learning/colleges-adapt-changing-students.html,With Changing Students and Times  Colleges Are Going Back to School Many colleges and universities are facing a gloomy picture  painted by polls  politics and population shifts that are forcing an overhaul of campuses across the country. None Supported by None H. Fred Walker stood before his Edinboro University community on a recent snowy day and issued a warning. “We have been very insular in that we have not looked beyond the boundaries of Edinboro ” the college president told a group of staff and students who had gathered at a meeting in this town tucked away in Northwestern Pennsylvania to hear the details of the college’s strategic plan. “When we’re judged against our peers  it’s a punch in the eye for us.” While it was difficult for many in the room to hear  it was a reality years in the making for Edinboro  a four-year public university with an enrollment of about 6 000 students that is part of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education. In the last decade  enrollment has plummeted  faculty salaries have caused expenses to skyrocket and completion rates have dissipated. No longer is the school’s most promising pipeline the average teenager going to college for the first time  but more likely the adult who may need to go back for a second or third. After 160 years as an anchor of rural Pennsylvania  the university is becoming obsolete. “There’s a reckoning that has to come ” Mr. Walker said in an interview in early March. None It is one of the most striking  but not unusual  signs of tumult gripping higher education institutions across the nation as they look for ways to thrive in the next century. Edinboro is among many colleges and universities facing a gloomy picture — painted by polls  politics and population shifts — that are forcing an overhaul of campuses. Amid a growing disillusionment with higher education  thousands of institutions are seeking ways to adapt to a rapidly changing landscape that has been destabilized by skeptics  an impatient work force and a fierce conservative populist streak. For colleges  that means re-examining centuries worth of practice. At Edinboro  that means gone are the days of educating for education’s sake. None Mr. Hannan said the university had been ignoring signs for at least a decade when  even amid a demographic downturn  it was building new dormitories instead of bracing for the market changes. “Unfortunately  in our case  there was no concerted  strategic effort and we’re trying to change that at this point ” he said in an interview as provost. “I don’t know if we thought we’d be the exception.” None None “Too many Americans  particularly working-class Americans  are not sure that the return on investment is as high as it could be anymore ” said Terry W. Hartle  senior vice president of government and public affairs at the American Council on Education. “And that’s where we have to do a better job.” None None “The effect of this divide on views of higher education — a pivotal element of the American dream for so many — raises questions about the future of higher education in this country ” a Gallup analysis said. That is particularly true for universities like Edinboro  which have thrived on their ability to convince white  working-class families that their limited resources were well spent sending their teenagers to be shaped into the next generation of great thinkers. Now  with shifting demands  Edinboro and other universities are looking at eliminating several programs that have traditionally carried that goal  a move that some call the next war on the liberal arts. None “All of a sudden  you woke up one day and students were dropping English majors because they want jobs ” Mr. Schneider said. None Mr. Hannan said the school was sensitive to preserving liberal arts majors — like political science and history — in its review  though some specialties would be discontinued. “Without some of those programs  you have to question whether or not you are a university ” Mr. Hannan said. “But for better or worse  many students are career-minded  and we have to respond to that.” The university plans to emphasize co-curricular activities  leadership and life skills  and experiential learning opportunities in its new plan. It will also double the size and budget of its career center. None While the evidence of the benefits of higher education has never been more pronounced  the prevalence of stories about the lack of jobs and high student loan debt have put colleges on notice. But it wouldn’t be the first time. The demise of colleges and universities has been forecast time and again  Mr. Hartle said. And higher education is often targeted as a culprit of societal misgivings  usually during the most politically divisive eras — they emerged in narratives during the Communist hearings and Vietnam protests. “Anything that’s been around in the same place  doing the same function for 150 years has shown it can change ” Mr. Hartle said. “But nobody can be comfortable  and any institution that assumes that past success guarantees the future is being foolish.” Besides  higher education is facing a new threat in the business of creating and transmitting information. That keeps Joseph E. Aoun  president of Northeastern University in Boston  up at night. While other presidents in local college towns worry about competing for endowments and enrollment  Mr. Aoun sees another threat: robots. None That thinking positioned Mr. Aoun on the fringe of higher education strategizing just a few years ago  but he is now called on weekly to advise other institutions on how to help their students outsmart the workers of the future. He calls this strategy humanics — a staple of Northeastern’s program that requires computer science majors to take theater classes. The idea is to give students the ability to solve the world’s most pressing problems in a way that robots cannot — with empathy. Or as he puts it: “I haven’t seen a computer that weeps.” None While other colleges are trying to get their students to use the career center  Northeastern has students in companies in 136 countries and on every continent  including Antarctica. “The students are the ones who are in tune with the world ” Mr. Aoun said. “They’re bringing the experience to us  and getting us out of our comfort zone.” The urban campus is described as having a “workaholic” vibe  and a running joke is that nobody looks twice at a student walking around campus in a suit. Chaitri Gulati  a third-year student at Northeastern  was drawn to the school because of the Co-op program  and because “sitting in class would not just be for the sake of taking examinations and intellectual enrichment.” Ms. Gulati  who is studying economics and political science  is at Wellington Management’s London office  where she is working with an investment team  and more important  applying theoretical concepts learned in her classes to understanding the investment process. “The more such experiences I have  the more I learn what role I wish to play now but also later in life ” Ms. Gulati said. Northeastern is not hurting for students: it has posted record application numbers for the past nine years and last fall got 62 000 applications for 2 800 freshman seats. But Mr. Aoun is hoping to meet another demand — what Northeastern calls the lifetime learner. For too long  Mr. Aoun said  lifelong learning had been deemed a “second-class operation.” None Where others see a challenge  Mr. Aoun sees an opportunity. “There’s a lot of anxiety right now ” he said. “But I believe we’re in the golden age of higher education.” Edinboro University  on the other hand  is trying to climb out of the Dark Ages. The overhaul will touch virtually every corner of the college  starting with who walks through the door. The school toughened admissions requirements to weed out local students who have traditionally turned to Edinboro as their only education option. It is a painful reality  but so are their outcomes. Though the college has accepted nearly everyone who applied  its enrollment has plummeted nearly 30 percent in the last five years. It has a 38 percent attrition rate  and poor four-year and six-year graduation rates  at 27 percent and 49 percent. None Marc Sylvester  president of Edinboro’s faculty union  said the faculty supported key elements of Edinboro’s plan forward  including raising admission standards and overhauling program offerings.

Advertisement Supported by Student Opinion None What exactly is cultural appropriation? None “taking intellectual property  traditional knowledge  cultural expressions  or artifacts from someone else’s culture without permission.” This can include the “unauthorized use of another culture’s dance  dress  music  language  folklore  cuisine  traditional medicine  religious symbols  etc.” Other Times articles have called it “a sign of disrespect and exploitation” and “a word now associated with the white Western world’s co-opting of minority cultures.” Can you recall any examples of cultural appropriation from the news or your own life? What were they and what made them disrespectful or exploitative? None When Keziah Daum wore a Chinese-style dress to her high school prom in Utah  it set off an uproar — but not because of its tight fit or thigh-high slit. None None None None None When the furor reached Asia  though  many seemed to be scratching their heads. Far from being critical of Ms. Daum  who is not Chinese  many people in mainland China  Hong Kong and Taiwan proclaimed her choice of the traditional high-necked dress as a victory for Chinese culture. None None None — In your opinion  when does something cross the line from “cultural exchange” into “appropriation” and why? — With more access to other cultures and perspectives via the internet  do you think people today have a greater responsibility to seek out and attempt to understand how their use of cultural artifacts might offend others?

Invite them to post them here  or email us at LNFeedback@nytimes.com. Please note: All student comments have been lightly edited for length  but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted. _________ None None The way the school handled the so-called dress code violation was completely inappropriate. Lizzy was not violating the dress code  requiring girls to wear bras is not even in the handbook. It was not within the administrations rights to call her out... Not only was it not in their rights but it also clearly made Lizzy uncomfortable and violated. Making her walk around the room while they scrutinized her was inappropriate. Lizzy hadn’t even heard anything about her not wearing a bra until she got called into the dean’s office. It obviously was not a problem because she would have seen people staring and laughing at her. There was really no reason for her to be called into the office for something so silly. None The problem I have with this situation is the fact that the dress code does not actually have anything saying female students are required to wear a bra  but she was still forced to bear a cruel and unusual punishment which only drew more attention to her. From what I have seen this school’s dress code is not too strict  but this case was handled very poorly. None I am entirely shocked by this. Dress code has always been an extreme all over America  as far as I know  and no one can deny it is aimed at girls. Even though it is always brought up that OTHER people  namely men and boys  are distracted. That’s so messed up. We shouldn’t be punishing girls for something that is out of their control. If a man can’t control himself he is no better than an animal  and they should be punished themselves. I completely get there needs to be some set of rules. You can’t come to school wearing basically just underwear  but girls should not be forced to wear bras if they don’t want to! Girls should be able to wear tank tops and shorts when it’s 70+ degrees Fahrenheit outside! The restrictions are wrong and downright humiliating. None I agree it was inappropriate of Lizzy to go to school without a bra  but the way administration handled the situation was inappropriate and unfair. If the school’s dress code did not specifically state females were required to wear bras  no one had the right to order Lizzy to put a bra on. Lizzy did not break any rule and should have not been reprimanded for something  which was completely justified for her to do. If it had been an boy with “man boobs” would they require him to wear a bra too? I think not. I do not believe the school was intentionally being sexist  but they need to think before they act next time! None When faced with a question such as this  one must first consider what the point of dress codes are. In some areas  such as military institutions  dress codes bring conformity. If you look at successful CEO’s such as Steve Jobs  they wear the same thing over and over. While this may make them appear boring  it enables them to not waste valuable energy and brainpower deciding what to wear. When students do not need to decide what to wear each day  they are able to put more focus and energy into schoolwork. Especially at my school  dress codes aren’t just to be annoying. In addition to allowing students to conserve brainpower  they also remove unnecessary distractions caused by students wearing revealing or distracting clothing. None Honestly  I am very disappointed in the way that the school handled the situation. Lizzy clearly was minding her own business  wanted to stay pain-free  and did not want to cause any trouble shown by her previous actions in wearing clothing that would have some flow to it. The administrators  made fun of her and her body  and went to strange and extreme lengths despite that no one around her in class mentioned or was disturbed by her not wearing a bra. They should have maybe found a sweatshirt for Lizzy  not recommend putting band-aids on  plus this situation just feels so dramatized when the handbook did not make a direct statement in the first place. None Lizzy’s so called dress code violation was handled with very poorly. Firstly  the school was very ignorant for not knowing their own Code of Conduct and for forcing Lizzy to do more than what she agreed to in this Code. Secondly  even after Lizzy complied and put on the undershirt  the administration then made her do more because they could still see her nipples at an specific angle. Lizzy was made uncomfortable both physically and emotionally by the school’s administration. It shouldn’t have been considered a violation in the first place because there is nothing clearly stated in the Code of Conduct that makes her have to cover up with a bra. The administrators should have left this entire situation alone because it was never a violation  but then it also called attention to Lizzy not wearing a bra when not that many students or teachers cared or noticed in the first place. To wear a bra is ultimately a decision for the student to do and the school can’t and shouldn’t do anything about. None Lizzie’s only mistake was not putting on enough sunscreen. How can she be expected to wear something so constricting while having a burn on her shoulders? Also  according to their handbook she wasn’t in any violation. It’s not in the administrations place to call her out for it  and the entire situation is incredibly disrespectful to her privacy. Lizzie would have noticed if people we “laughing” at her for not wearing a bra  and if no one was  it’s ovbiously not a massive conflict like the principal made it out to be. I’d say dress codes are definitely more discriminatory to girls than guys. We can’t wear leggings or a shirt showing a little bit of shoulder without it being “innappropiate and distracting” to the male population. None I think the school and administration handled the situation poorly. The school’s handbook had no policy saying that girls are required to wear bras to school. It was Lizzy’s choice to go to to school with no bra on  so if she was getting any unwanted attention or uncomfortable she could change into a bra if she wanted to. The administration should not have done anything. _________ None None Well  now days students aren’t taught to be taught. We’re taught to pass the test. If you don’t you re take the test until you pass or you can’t graduate. ( In some states like Texas) my sister had to take the English 1 STAAR every year of high school. Thankfully she passed her senior year. I don’t think her test scores reflected her intelligence at all. Pleanty of children have testing anxiety. They freak out when it comes to taking the tests.In my personal experience I broke my ankle my 6th grade year. I had to go to the orthopedic surgeon the morning of my math STAAR. I was late to the test and my leg was uncomfortable because I had just had a new cast put on. I nearly failed that test. I know it wasn’t my intelligence that brought my score down.Often times the tests are during flu and allergy season. So many kids go to school sick just to take the tests. In fact last year many of my friends and I went to school sick just so we could pass the 9th grade.In short the tests are useless  and inefficient. These test scores don’t reflect us or how smart we really are. None Standardized tests do not accurately assess my knowledge and abilities. For the eight years that I have taken them  I have gotten very high scores. Of course  I felt happy  but annoyed at the same time. The company who produces the test  in my case it is the PARCC test  does not know what type of student I am. They have no idea how much I try  or even what my grades are. It is my score on that one day that I see  and just because I am a good test taker  that is all that matters. This year  I must pass the math section of the PARCC in order to graduate high school. Regardless of my grades  if I fail this test than I will not pass middle school. Standardized tests are not fair for kids who are straight A students but bad test takers. Their must be another way to judge progress  rather than a one day test. It should grades of students which are the real focus. They give an accurate picture of who students are. When I take this version of the PARCC test in a few weeks  I will put in my full effort  but all the while knowing that the results will not be showing who I really am academically. None Standardized tests are becoming more of a norm for students across the world. It seems like they just keep stacking up to the point where students are forgetting what this particular test is and focusing on just finishing it and not doing their best. Teachers  administrators  and parents do try to encourage students to do well on these test  but I believe that even they fall into the monotency of standardized testing. These test are not a accurate representation of many traits and values that will assist students more in the workforce than a good grade on a test. These tests are also taking valuable classroom time for students who are meant to be learning to prepare them for skills they need to acquire for the future. Students should be able to demonstrate their knowledge and abilities in other ways that actually help them achieve success in their future careers  like a skills workshop that students compete in their proposed career cluster. Standardized testing is somewhat necessary as we do need a way to be able to rank students success and progress  but too much of it is causing good students to underachieve. None Standardized testing was created to make money for organizations who claimed that they would accurately test students on their skills for the lives they were prepared to lead. The teachers don’t like them probably more than the students  as we’re constantly being taken from their classes for “prep” and the tests themselves. Parents worry that their children are being pushed too hard  being made to take six standardized tests within a single year in order to “qualify” for college. What these tests don’t take into account  however  is that the knowledge they’re expecting students to have for their questions haven’t been memorized by all the students taking them. The tests are generalized for the entire student body  with problems from elementary level to AP course level  and not all students have been introduced to the higher level material being tested.To fix this  schools could give a personalized test based on the classes students had taken (i.e everything up to Algebra  everything up to English 2 Honors) at the end of the year that accurately measured the level of command students have over the skills they’d been taught that year  and the years before. This would precisely measure how well they knew the material they’d been taught  rather than test them on the skills they’d never been introduced to. None Although I agree standardized testing is necessary in education  there seems to be an inordinate amount of testing  especially for high school juniors. Without a certain amount of standardized tests  it would be extremely challenging to measure basic academic skills and abilities. However  as an AP student  I find it very annoying that I have to miss valuable class periods to take standardized tests that test standards rather than intellectual abilities. I recognize their purpose and function  but I believe that there has to be a more efficient method to assessing student knowledge. A more individualized approach to standardized testing could perhaps allow every student to adequately express their individual skills and abilities.Personally  I do not feel that much pressure from parents and teachers to perform well on tests. I believe that education is my own responsibility and that my scores reflect more on my individual abilities rather than those of my instructors. Granted teacher’s jobs often do depend on student performance  many times pressure from adults stems from a desire to see students do well. The pressure I face on standardized tests often comes from myself  sometimes unnecessarily. I do not enjoy standardized tests  but I do have personal motivation to perform well on them. None As an 11th grade high school student  I have been through my fair share of standardized tests. The MAP and PASS tests in elementary school  and they continued into middle school  and now in high school the ACT  PSAT  SAT  WIN  Accuplacer  and the ASVAB. Something notable is what the tests are trying to achieve. Through elementary school and middle school the MAP and the PASS made sure we were meeting our standards. However  in high school  we have exams to track our yearly progression  which opens up more opportunities for tests for future jobs and college placement. All this testing may seem like lots of extra work  but I think it is a necessary evil. If all colleges require one or more of the tests to be taken by an applicant  we might as well take them in high school. That way  if we need to have a do-over we will have plenty of time to do so. Also  tests like the WIN and Accuplacer are preparing us for jobs that could be in our future. I think that the tests in elementary school and middle school are accurate enough to test the standards  but the tests in high school are more important because they can have a large impact on your future. I personally do not feel overly pressured to do well on these tests. I try to do well because I want to do well. All in all  standardized tests are not fun  but they are important. None I believe that there’s too much standardized testing in general  not just at my school. Standardized testing eats up valuable class time and adds unnecessary pressure to an already stressful environment. I personally feel stressed due to standardized testing because the work load during that time always feels more daunting. I do not believe that testing is an accurate way to assess knowledge mostly beacams of the time constraints  some students work slower than others  but that doesn’t mean they are any less smart. By rushing these students  their abilities are not able to shine through. None We have standardized testing in kindergarten! The 5-year-olds are given a page of size 10 font to read. They don’t usually read like this! It’s overwhelming that your teacher tells you to read so many words without pictures and then hurry up too. All of this is done to start gaging baseline scores for data. The results confuse and make anxious kids and parents alike. Public school kindergarteners should not be used as data points. Cognitive development recognizes that kids do not start learning to read until they are seven. Let the kids be kids and don’t start testing until grade 3 like the Finns! None I think that standardized testing in school is not to much we can handle. Well you have to think about it if you can´t take it now how are you going to prevail when your an adult. Sometimes I do feel pressured not from my teachers but from myself. I am always thinking ¨will I get 100% or fail I really need to do well.¨ This is what I tell myself before every test that come upon me. I´m not quivering in my own shoes about just nervous. Standardized test do push my knowledge to the test  push my thinking ability harder  and smarter. It really gets your brain worker at it´s maximum capacity. So standardized testing doesn’t really bother me at all. Also teachers are doing a fantastic job preparing us students to do our best on every test that come our way. _________ None None It’s very cool that Kendrick Lamar’s album won the Pulitzer Prize  and I do believe it was well earned. The album is serious and talks about important issues. Lamar should be proud  and it’s a win-win for being the first rapper to win the Pulitzer  and for being the first non-classical or jazz musician. I hope this win will attract many other people to listen to the album  especially those who wouldn’t normally listen to rap music. As the board called the album  it was a “virtuosic song collection” and had “vernacular authenticity and rhythmic dynamism.” The album was very popular  and though classical musicians or jazz musicians who usually win may be angry that they didn’t win  hip hop music is something fresh and different among the past Pulitzer winners. His songs and the album have a lot of meaning and I think he deserved the prize. None Kendrick Lamar’s ‘DAMN’ deserved to win the Pulitzer prize  without a doubt. As the jurors had said  the genre of Hip-hop/rap has “value on its own terms” especially when it comes to someone like Kendrick  the wordplay and context in his music makes the album that much better. To be able to incorporate modern African american life into an album and make it sound good is what sets this album apart from others  but it is nothing new from Kendrick Lamar since he’s done it before with “To pimp a butterfly” and “Good kid  M.A.A.D City” but DAMN. Just goes to prove that the influence of Hip-hop on modern culture can’t be ignored anymore. Mr. Hajdu says that in recent years  the people behind the prize have “sought to assertively think and listen more expansively  with open ears” since the prize has been awarded primarily to classical artists and later onto Jazz and now in the genre of Hip-hop to Kendrick. Without bias  another hip-hop influence  J. Cole  could easily win a Pulitzer prize in my eyes  his current release KOD is genius and has potential to win if ever nominated but Apart from the fact a classical composer called it “insulting”  I disagree because DAMN. was worth the win in my opinion  what Kendrick crafted  not many others can do. None Kendrick Lamar’s album was certainly worthy of the Pulitzer prize. It says alot about the current state of rap music and sheds light on the advanced lyricism and creativity that went into the making of not only ‘DAMN’ but many other of Kendrick’s previous albums. Kendrick is definitely the most deserving of this award out of all the artists in the hip-hop genre. Along with other hip-hop artists such as J cole  Kanye  and Drake  Kendrick has greatly influenced the culture of this genre. His ability to over come countless obstacles in his child hood to get where he is now speaks volumes. This shows younger artists that its possible to achieve a new level of success in this genre because it is becoming more widely accepted in our society. _________ None None I can’t believe all of I read. I can’t believe in the United States a country that a lot of people want to come to live here and to get better future  the school conditions are bad. How is possible this happen in this country? What happen with our leaders in each state? Why the relevant authorities ignore the situation of our schools? I was surprised with each descriptions  pictures and that teachers spend their own money from their own pockets for supply materials exceeding these over 1 000 dollars and when they have a low salary. That is impossible to believe. It is irrelevant to say that the government should prioritize spending money on education and they have to create a consistent method to support the majority of our schools  because in the future this will help to get better education for our children  furthermore  teachers will feel more passionate and focus on their students and their vocation and not to worry about books  pencils  school furniture  computers and other things. I think every school should have a significant budget to use for all of materials required every student. If my school had a bigger budget I think it should be spent on create diverse activities such as art  music  buying more books to motivate reading. At the same time  the schools can help parents to be involve in every school activity. None My school can’t afford a lot. Despite teachers’ low salaries  my school still can’t afford basic needs like copies and books. It’s been a while since the textbooks have been replaced  but just this year the school has implemented strict limits on teachers’ copies. Hearing these stories of teachers being on the edge of poverty really makes me angry. They are working in desolate conditions  being forced to pay upward of 1 000 of their own dollars a year on basic things they can’t teach without. My mom is a teacher and thankfully has never suffered any of these extreme situations  but she still is underpaid in my opinion for a teacher with a masters degree and about 15 years of experience. The local governments need to hear these teachers and provide them with the fiscal support they need. I don’t know enough about their budget to suggest a change  but there must be some government program that either is overpaid or just unnecessary. This should be a more discussed issue and at the forefront of local politics. None Wow! I knew the education systems all around were struggling but I did not think it was this bad. My school has been fortunate enough to be able to build a second gym  a new cafeteria  and will be replacing damaged floors in some rooms. While I think it absurd that we built a second gym instead of an auditorium or redoing the bathrooms or buying textbooks or anything else  it is evident that the fact we have the money is extraordinary. After reading the article and looking at pictures of water stained ceilings and ducked taped textbooks and bare library shelves it is obvious that schools all around need more funding. I would gladly give up my new gym to give these people furniture for their classrooms and textbooks and renovate their buildings. After reading the article it is clear that years teaching does not influence the amount one is paid  in fact I noticed that some younger teachers were getting paid more than more experienced teachers. I also noticed that the annual out-of-pocket expenses of teachers ranged anywhere from $300 to $2000  that is unacceptable  your job should only make you money not cost you money. David Russell builds bookshelves and paints his classroom  Beth Etzler furnished her whole room herself with her own money  these are all things the government should be doing  not the teachers. None When I was primary student in Japan  the Great East Japanese Earthquake occurred in our country. Our classes were broken and we lost almost all furniture and many textbooks at the time. After the happened  many schools had received donation from other parts of Japan or countries for restoration assistance following the Greatest East Japan Earthquake. Even we had received these supports  we had been taking classes without furniture during a year. Students and teachers were sitting down on school yard but we were very happy taking classes with all  even though we didn’t have any textbooks and furniture.15 000 people were killed in the Earthquake and all students of my school was safe. Still now many people are living in temporary housing and some children don’t go to school because the school have not rebuilt yet. I am sad about this article because some schools have bad conditions  but for me there are classes  furniture  and textbooks even though these are dirty and broken  it is fine. At least taking classes in dirty place is better than no place to take classes. They should broaden one’s view. None While I agree entirely how America could have it much worse  only 2% of federal tax dollars go towards public education. Intercity schools take the worst hit due to living in an impoverished environment. In addition  living in that circumstance would deter one’s perseverance and ambition. However  I agree with your claim that people should work hard  but it is not a reality most of the time. Once born into poverty  it is difficult to get out of it. Most inner city public schools also don’t set up a path for their students to be able to go to college and get a degree to help them in their desired career path. Children born into poverty have a slim chance of having a professional degree. Instead  they have to settle for vocational or manual labor like construction workers  etc. Given this information  I pose a couple of questions: Why isn’t the government giving more money to public schools? What percentage (if they raised government spending on education) should/ would be taken away from other areas of government spending? Is this morally right? Does medicare  benefits for veterans  and social security deserve less government money? What should it be spent on? None I found this article very interesting  but I think there are two unspoken issues related to this subject. First  teachers having tenure prevents school administrations from firing them for poor performance. This is largely because of teacher unions funding elections and paying politicians for pro-union laws. The other issue is that the government is spending a lot of money things that could be prevented by an excellent education. Well-educated people are less likely to smoke  well-educated people are less likely to drink  well-educated people are less likely to commit crimes. I wonder  could we spend more money in education  so that we would not have to spend so much on welfare? None The money that a school should first go to the teachers. If we look at countries with the best education today  they all share one thing in common  good pay to teachers. In my opinion  schools should add every single teacher’s paycheck a minimum of 10 grand. Teachers are the ones who raised past generations  raising my generation currently  and will raise even more to come. They HAVE to be rewarded. None Our school  (Concord High)  definitely needs more money. Our school doesn’t even compare to Hickory Ridge  Cox Mill  or JM Robinson. There are so many things that need to improve in this school. Half of the school is somewhat new while the other half is nearly 50 years old. This presents problems in multiple ways. The older half is very poorly designed and the flow of students is very bad. We have one of the smallest commons area that I’ve seen leading people to stand in the hallway. Probably the most frustrating thing is that instead of improving our school or other schools in the district like ours  the county decides to build another school. This school will millions in which we could have used to greatly improve our struggling school. Unfortunately the best solution to this problem is to build a new concord high school. However  this probably wont happen for a while  despite the terrible school experience. None Education is broadening and developing therefore schools need to do so as well. Education is necessary for a person to be able to succeed in life. To get any well paying job  one needs education. New information is being discovered therefore new information needs to be taught and distributed so people and their knowledge can develop with the world that is also developing. Money can be used by schools to do so by purchasing things such as computers  new textbooks  new technology  or virtual accounts to aid in teaching (i.e. khan academy). Personally I think that schools should spend the money on technology such as computers or laptops. The world is turning into a very digital community and most information in online. Purchasing more technology for schools can give students and teachers access to this new and upcoming information. This then allows fro a better quality education for students who need education to succeed in life. None Growing up  I always wanted to be a teacher. Now that I am in high school  I face the struggle with choosing if education is the path I should take in college. Almost on the daily  when asked what I want to do after college  and answer become a teacher  the responses I get include “but they make such little money ” “are you sure?” and “you’re going to be poor ” which is discouraging to say the least. I believe that governments should prioritize spending money on education. Getting an education is one of the most important things in a child’s life to help them succeed. Teachers get paid very little even though they are basically shaping children’s lives. With a failing education system  we get children with less or false knowledge who don’t know what is happening in the world now  or what happened in the past. The world and education today is not the same as textbooks from 10 years and beyond teach it is. _________ None None (This may offend some people  read at your own discretion.) Honestly  after reading this article  reading the story that follows it and an article named “Stop Telling Women To Smile”  I just don’t see it. People complain over these problems  if you can even call them that  and don’t see a simple solution: Ignore the person if it pains you that much to flex a couple muscles in your face. I think the woman who went a time period without smiling proved a great point whilst also contradicting her 1st argument: It is extremely hard to hold back a smile  or joy  or laughter  it’s simply human nature. This doesn’t only cater to women too  men are told to smile by other men or worse things about their appearance like “Oh you look like ____ today what happened?” or what I see as equivalent of telling women to smile  telling a man to shave. Personally when someone asks me too smile  I smile. As a waiter at a family business I happily oblige when some asks or “Demands” that I smile because that tells me i’m not doing my job properly of greeting and waiting on people with hospitality and comfort. Needless to say I understand that there is a “Social Construct” and some people don’t see it as fit to have this in place but if we didn’t have such things in place then civilization might be in a much worse place than it is now. So like I said in the first paragraph  I hate to be harsh but people need to get over it because we as a civilization have much more pressing issues to get over. None In most pictures  especially in high school portraits  you will notice female students smile while the male students have a blank  relaxed expression. It has become a societal norm in the United States for boys to appear secretive and emotionless and girls to be friendly and kind. Smiling has become a greeting  for example when you pass a stranger in the grocery store. Smiling shows that you are a kind  friendly person  just as girls are expected to be. It brought me no surprise to read the citizens of the United States smile more often than others. In this country there is a popular tendency to hide discontent. Social media influences has created a need for people to smile  and share their “good times” with the world. People are forcing smiles because that is what you are “supposed” to do. But just like males  women don’t HAVE to smile  or come off as a gentle person. We can be as happy as can be without showing it  and there is no obligation to do so. Smile for yourself because it means something to you and because it’s natural. We do so much in this world by force for the betterment of our future  sacrifice forcing to smile for the betterment of yourself. Maybe one day like Ms. Ko we will smile from true  personal connection. None First  I work in a restaurant and sometimes I have to take orders. I really like to smile  because I like to feel comfortable with the people even though they do not care. A smile can change our day and I have my own experiences when I feel sad and someone smile me I think the people can share their happiness through of smile. None I think that smiled is the best way to express our feelings. If you are happy  if you see someone that you know  or because you want smiled is perfect. The problem is when other people tell you that you need smile. Why? Is very uncomfortable do that if you do not want. May be you have a bad day  or you do not feel good or only you do not want. I think that the people smiled more depending on where they worn born. For example  I am from Spain  and in Europe the people think that we are very happies and that always are smiled. Other countries like Italia or France smiled to much  but for example others countries like Germany or Switzerland do no laugh so much  it is usually more serious. This is the way that the people is and each one is as it is. I believe that what is important is to feel good about yourself  no matter what the people are thinking. If you want to laugh perfect  but if is not good to do it by obligation. None I really liked her experiment of not smiling for a day. Like she said  “If a smile is the appearance of happiness  then to be commanded to smile takes away our right to our own feelings.” Forcing another person to feel happy or just forcing emotions into to other people. We have a right to feel how we feel because people walking by on the street don’t know what is going on in your life. Plus  I think that a lot of people view happy as the “right” feeling but there is no “right” feeling. If you’re sad  you can be sad  and if you’re angry  be angry. People need to respect others people’s business because they don’t know what is going on in their personal life. None I hate when my teachers tell me to smile  because what is the reason for us to smile well unless were taking a picture together  otherwise no. None “You look pretty when you smile  so smile”. No  I am not going to smile to conform to your standard of beauty. If you go away maybe I’ll smile. However  my face naturally appears annoyed  mad  and gloomy. I will not go out of my way to please you. Concealing my feelings will only have a negative impact on me in the long run. _________ None None My mom and I are remarkably close  but that doesn’t mean that I am immune from what Lisa Damour described about wanting nothing more than to separate myself from my parents. My mom is the first person I turn to when I am upset and need someone to lean on and she is also the first person I go to when something amazing happens. She knows me better than anyone  but because she is a parent  a lot of pressure comes from her. Even when she tries not to put pressure on me (because I put enough of it on myself)  I am still worried about how she will react if I don’t succeed. I think it is almost an innate want to please your parents no matter how many times they tell you they just want you to be happy. Just because people are parent and child does not make them automatically compatible. Like  Michelle Kuo wrote  some parents will simply have different view points and ideals about how kids should be raised and the decisions they make as adults. However  I completely agree with the other part she said  about loving them no matter how confused and disapproving they might be about your choices because a parent’s love is probably the one truly unconditional love in life and they will always be there  wishing the best for you. Again  even the best parent-child relationships will have ups and downs. Sometimes when somebody knows you so well  it can be frustrating and infuriating. I also know that no matter what  my mom will always be my best friend and the one person I can always rely on. None All of the rules that Ms. Kuo and Ms. Dampour list can be boiled down to one word: empathy. The basis of any healthy relationship is a common care and respect  one that must be mutual no matter the situation. The same rule applies with parent and teenagers. The parent should think back to when they were young  and imagine what they would do. By doing this  they are putting themselves in the shoes of the teenager empathizing. The teenager should take a minute  and imagine what it is like to be a parent. This is hard-I am a teenager too-but it will work. There are always two sides to every story  so trying to understand the other point of view will make a consensus much easier to achieve. None Everyone has a unique relationship with their parents. Some have an open and honest relationship  where they feel that they can talk to their parent. On the other hand some are not so lucky and the relationship may not always be secure and safe. Their really is no set of advice that you can give to work for everyone. I think a good start is communication. For example  my mom and I are extremely close. I know I can talk to her about anything. I think that a secure relationship at least one parent is crucial. Our lives are constantly changing  with friends coming and going  social media  and the daily dramas of high school. Having some stability even if it’s just at home can be comforting. Personally  coming home to my mom asking “How was your day love?” is the best part  because even if I’ve had the worst day on the planet talking to her always makes me feel better. In regards to what Ms.Kuo wrote  I definitely can agree with some of the things on her list. Especially with her closing statement stating “They might not ever see things the way you do and that’s O.K. Show them love as best you can.” That statement was really important to me because no matter what they are your parents the only ones you’ve got. It may not always be a walk in the park but no matter what happens you know they’ll always be there for you. None i can heavily relate to this article because of my own personal experiences. i don’t get along with my parents due to our differences of opinion on many things. I’ve grown up and realized i’m different from that and i think deep down they know  but they won’t admit it. The advice Kuo gives was very helpful. He explains to still love your children and accept differences.Ms. Kuo makes a list on ways she disappointed her parents and i can add to that my political views and the people i choose to date and the amount of fun i like to have. my parent are too upright and they worry too much about what other people think when they should not. i am very different from them and will have a different identity from them  but i never disrespect them so i disagree with Ms. damours opinion. None I believe that parents should become more open-minded when it comes to their kids and the decision they decide to make. I think every parents wants the best for their kids but sometimes the way they present that information/ideas is not the most helpful. The advice that Kuo gives really put things into perspecrtive by trying to get us as teenagers to look at things from a parents view. I think that being a teenager we struggle with a lot of identity issues  many of us are still trying to figure out what we like or what we want to do with our lives. My opinion would be for the parents to present us with a little more room to breathe  because we all know our parents were in the position we were in at once and instead of trying to find our paths for us all us to do that on our own with the support from a distance. _________ None None When I see this image  I think of the creativity that flows through a writer. This is person is able to take the points of many different views and piece it together to make something original. All of the writer’s different characters were kept in mind as he writes. None This picture seems to represent the idea of what makes writing: experience. At first I assumed that this was the burden of people who he carries with him  but that comes from my own pessimistic personality. I can see how with every person who grasps onto him holds their own pencil  as if they all have a story to tell. That feels like he is writing from his past  with every form of him that built up to who he is now. I can get that same way when I just write with no intention  where the pages start to flood with memories of me torturing myself with math homework or how I felt when I turned an enemy into a friend. Memories are different entities all together  and each piece is still floating around somewhere  no matter how we change. None When I see this image  I think of what happens when you write a story. You come up with these fictional characters  humans that are not actually human. You write out lives for people you will never meet. Sometimes you get so involved you know where a characters great great grandmother was born. For me  I can spend hours developing one character before I even start the story. When I do finally get to my story  my characters help me write. That’s what the floating silhouettes represent. Their appearance affects the way the world is described in their eyes. Their personality affects the way they react to trauma and other emotions. What they see is totally different to the way another character sees something. This is what this picture says to me. None Writing portrays deep thought and emotion of the person composing. I often take the time to write poetry. In my opinion  this picture depicts all the different influences that often affect someone when they put words on paper. It also portrays all the different emotions that comes with it. Writing is so much more than just the influence of a single person. I often find myself writing in the perspective of other people  in order to generalize and encompass a larger group of people  rather than just those who can relate to me. _________ None None I myself live in the Philly area. However  I have not really seen or heard discrepancy against anybody of any race  gender  age  or sexual orientation. I think it is because of the fact that I’m usually trapped in my own head while walking down the street  or playing outside with my siblings. I have  however  seen discrimination of every kind online  whether it be chat rooms  video game chats  or social media. I hadn’t really been made aware that it happened so much outside of the internet until about last year  when stories started showing up in my news feed. This happens to be one of the stories that crossed my feed. I’m am sickened by that fact that is kind of treatment still exists today in our society. I think that Starbucks is making the right decision by giving its employees anti-bias training. Lots of people today are very biased against others  and this can lead to problems for everyone. I think that companies should offer anti-bias training  but not make it mandatory. I don’t think it should be mandatory  just because there are some people who have respect for those who are different from them. Forcing them to re-learn something that they already know would be rather pointless. None my opinion of this article is that what happened in Starbucks was horrible and how it was handled needs to change because this continues to happen everyday. The way starbucks handled it  by having anti-bias training for their employees was a good idea. IN my opinion all companies need to do this until the problem is solved. I’m tired of hearing stories about innocent black people getting accused of things  killed  discriminated against  and etc. All people should be treated the same no matter what. i would be scared and very frustrated if i were a black person living in Philadelphia or in any place where i get followed by police officers. None Situations like this pop up in the news when everything goes wrong. The situation begins when two guys walk into a Starbucks and sit down. I was unaware that loitering is such a big issue but  it is. Let me say that  I don’t think that this is race issue. The manager just wanted them to leave because they were not buying anything  even thought they said that they were waiting for someone. I honestly don’t understand why the manager couldn’t take their word on it. I think that calling the police was completely unnecessary considering the situation  but it happened. Although the situation ended so poorly  I must commemorate the police officers. There job is to keep the peace and solve civil issues. They resolved the issue as peaceful as possible. Do I think that the two men should have been arrested? No. But that doesn’t mean that the police did a bad job. Although it isn’t mentioned in the article  I read that the men sat down and talked with the Starbucks CEO. I don’t think that companies should have to implement anti bias training. At this stage in life  your employees should be able to respect other people regardless of their background. If this is not the case  then get rid of them. My Mom had to take a similar training course for her job and she didn’t learn anything. None Other companies should follow in Starbucks steps. If every company offers anti bias training  it will help to eliminate prejudice throughout the whole work force. Everybody is entitled to a hate free work environment  and companies must ensure that all employees feel comfortable. Kudos for Starbucks for recognizing that there is a problem  and for implementing appropriate measures. None In my opinion  the incident was handled very poorly by the policeman because they took unnecessary action and they were aided by the Starbucks employees. However  it should be up to the cops to make an overall decision whether the tip needed to be followed through  which I don’t believe it did. There is no reason these men should have gotten arrested because they were not being a bother to anyone inside the cafe. It could have been dealt with differently  perhaps by talking to them or addressing that they need to buy something in order to use the facilities  but it is unreasonable that they were handcuffed. Knowing the history  it wouldn’t be surprising that the decision made by police was racially biased because there have other incidents in this neighborhood where people have been targeted for irrational reasons. I think it is important for employees and schools to take a training class in making anti-bias decisions because it would stop incidents like this from happening  help people ignore stereotypes and single stories and it would be a cost-efficient way to address an everyday issue. None Although I am a black female who resides in Philadelphia  the color of my skin doesn’t change my opinion on the incident that occurred earlier this week at Starbucks. What those men went through sent a feeling of heartache through me. I believe that the police officers and Starbucks’ employees could have been more solution-oriented and payed more attention to what the men were saying. I believe that this situation portrayed the racial bias that many people hold in that area because of the rash and thoughtless way the men were handled. Starbucks’ decision to close its stores sets a great example to other stores that have had similar instances occur. Reading about other’s experiences opened my eyes to how close incidents like this happen around me. Even though steps are being taken to eliminating racism for good  for every step we take forward  we always take three steps backwards  I hope that one day African Americans can stand near police officers without fearing being irrationally arrested. _________ Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,students and education
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/education/learning/bulletin-board.html,Bulletin Board Advertisement Supported by A collection of views  news and more from the Learning section. About five million K-12 students in the United States do not speak English fluently  and their numbers are growing fast. While these children currently make up 10 percent of the total student population  researchers estimate that they could make up as much as 40 percent by 2030. Schools across the country are turning to technology to help them better serve these students — whose success will increasingly drive graduation rates  test scores and other school-quality metrics — and to help connect with their families. “Any time there’s an opportunity to quickly connect with a parent and not have the language be in the way  that’s a win for me and for the student ” said Tasia Fields  a technology administrator and former teacher in Waukegan Public Schools in Illinois. ClassDojo is among the most widely used home-to-school communication apps  and its automatic translation feature has created a way for teachers to develop relationships with parents despite language barriers. Ms. Fields said the app enabled regular contact with all parents — to discuss grades or attendance issues  for example — not just those who speak English. In the classroom  computer-based programs can give students additional support as they work to master the vocabulary and mechanics of English. ELLoquence  Istation and PreK12Plaza are among those that let students move through lessons at their own pace.  None None With about half of the students considered at-risk and the same amount performing behind grade level in reading and math  said the principal  Kathryn Procope  the school had to find better ways to engage and motivate students. “We tend to look at education as teacher-driven ” Ms. Procope said. “We drive  and the students kind of sit in the back seat and ride along with us. But now students are really participating and directing how this actually goes.” CityBridge — a nonprofit focused on improving Washington’s public schools in part by giving students a voice in the reform conversation — is helping the school  which is on the Howard University campus. The middle school has started using an online system to guide self-paced learning  and Ms. Procope is going one step further  letting the students help redesign the class schedule. Her hope is that if the school day is organized around the needs of more students  students will be better set up for success. Damont Morgan  a seventh grader  would prefer to get core academic classes that take a lot of mental energy out of the way in the morning and go to electives in the afternoon. As part of a pilot  he is testing this  and Ms. Procope plans to change the schedule schoolwide next year. She also plans to carve out time for students to choose what to study. When Damont had this freedom  he spent extra time in his science class  catching up. Having input is important. “A lot of schools ” he said  “they don’t really listen to the students and what they want.” None With more college students now considered nontraditional than traditional  higher education institutions have been scrambling to shift their models to better meet their needs. Many have turned to competency-based education  known as CBE  to reach the increasingly important returning adult learner. These students graduated from high school years ago and have work and life experiences that distinguish them from their young adult counterparts on campus. With competency-based education  they can earn credits for that. The idea is that students should not have to sit through lessons they have already learned. Once they prove their knowledge — competency — they can move on to new material. The model is popular with older learners who want to finish a degree as fast as possible  and online delivery means they can do it in evenings and weekends  or around their work and family commitments. None But competency-based education is hard to put into effect because it is so different from traditional higher education — in the way courses are designed  the way faculty members are expected to teach  how long courses take and how students should be charged. “The demand side is there ” said Howard Lurie  principal analyst at Eduventures. “The actual execution is limited.” None We asked students to tell us what they think about arming teachers. “Teachers have it hard enough already. You’re giving them more stress  worrying about this.” “I would think everyone would want armed guards and police officers in school. I think it would do nothing but good.” “I understand the rationale behind having a resource officer. But it’s not my personal preference. School should be a resource  not something you have to survive.”﻿ “The teacher’s job is to teach us  to be ready for the real world. We need to focus on that.” “We’re not going to stop these school shootings if we don’t have reactionary measures in place to stop the school shooters.” “Arming teachers is a completely half-baked and stupid idea. It’s a way for our politicians to dance around gun control.” — Interviews by Emily Cochrane. Illustrations by Kyle Hilton.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/sports/ncaabasketball/big-east-st-johns-mullin.html,Chris Mullin Preaches the Power of One Day at a Time On College Basketball During a long losing streak  the St. John’s basketball coach asked his players  “Where do you think I was on this date 30 years ago?” The answer was rehab. None Supported by None It has largely been a pinch-me basketball life  much of it spent in the practice gym  an Irish kid from Brooklyn obsessed with straight shooting. Chris Mullin  54  is still there  taking aim now with blunt talk. His third season at the coaching helm of St. John’s  where he was counseled by the raspy-voiced musings of Lou Carnesecca in the 1980s  began with the expectant fruition of a program rebuild  with N.C.A.A. tournament ambition. By the peak of winter  when afternoon light shifted too quickly into darkness  Mullin’s team was enshrouded in an 11-game Big East Conference losing streak. Mullin always appreciated how Carnesecca — still  at 93  a patriarchal presence around St. John’s — became less demanding in the face of adversity. How during Mullin’s freshman season the diminutive coach affectionately known as Looie walked into the locker room after an unsightly first-half effort against Georgetown and told his players they had had a figurative bowel movement on the Madison Square Garden floor  to go clean up as much of it as possible and then wipe it from their memory bank. “I don’t come in and break TVs when we lose ” Mullin said. “Practice  practice  practice — Coach Carnesecca did the same. You maintain that level of routine and it’ll work out.” For sure  the gym rat’s mantra. But what happens when the fundamental mistakes continue to be made  when the narrow defeats pile up to the point of being numbing  when injuries and defections have necessitated a six-man rotation confronting an unforgiving grind in a major conference? That  Mullin recognized  was an actual life challenge  a test of outside-the-lines character and a part of the personal journey he would rather share more than any singular competitive triumph from his Hall of Fame career. So one January afternoon  in the middle of the losing streak  he asked his players: “Where do you think I was on this date 30 years ago? I was on the Warriors  but where  exactly  do you think I was?” Blank stares came back at him. A few guesses. Chicago? Milwaukee? “No ” Mullin told them. “I was in rehab in Los Angeles.” In rehab for alcohol addiction  his early pro career at the proverbial crossroads. “They had no idea ” Mullin said of what would be ancient history to today’s 20-year-old. What his players did know  or had been told  was that four years later  Mullin was at the Olympics in Barcelona  Spain  alongside Magic Johnson  Michael Jordan and Larry Bird  cranking out textbook southpaw jump shots for the one and only Dream Team. The point being  life goes on. Narratives do change. “I’m not telling you to hang in there because some magical thing is going to happen ” Mullin told his team. “But this doesn’t have to be life and death. One practice at a time. One day at a time.” None But the tests of intestinal fortitude for coach and players didn’t conclude there  and won’t end with a season that must be objectively judged. And the revolving door of scholarship players perpetuates the long-pondered question of whether St. John’s can ever reinsert itself into the national conversation. None Even during that Dream Team summer  what he has called the apex of it all  he sat on a hotel room terrace overlooking the Mediterranean in Monte Carlo and told me: “I’m grateful to be here. I’m proud. But it’s just part of the road I’m taking.” After working in executive N.B.A. positions and passing time as a television analyst  Mullin returned to the architecturally muted campus on Union Turnpike in Jamaica  Queens  30 years after starring for Carnesecca in the Final Four. Some said it was a natural homecoming  a nostalgic leap — and risk — that he was destined to take. Others questioned what his tolerance level would be for the game within the game  duplicitous to the level of dirty  according to recent allegations and reports. Sitting in his office in the St. John’s practice facility  Mullin said he was not big on “fancy slogans” to contrive a program identity. He does not promote himself on social media. To the players he recruits  he is selling what he never regretted buying into — a New York experience  the Garden atmosphere on the night of a big game in Midtown Manhattan. “I do tell my personal experience  how I came to that decision  but what happened for me is going to vary ” Mullin said. “You can dress that up  but it’s not for everyone. Some kids need to leave  but for the ones that it’s the right fit  there’s nothing like it.” Losing makes for a harder sell. Mullin made his St. John’s coaching debut with a 90-58 exhibition defeat against St. Thomas Aquinas  a Division II school. His first-season record was 8-24  and then came modest improvement to 14-19  followed by this regular season’s 15-16 heading into the Big East tournament — where St. John’s will meet Georgetown on Wednesday. Because most of the 14 losses in the conference were not decisive  the 2017-18 what-ifs begin with a knee injury to the point guard Marcus LoVett  who with Shamorie Ponds formed one of the more intriguing backcourts in the country. LoVett played in seven games as the Red Storm began the nonconference schedule by winning 10 of 12  but then he got hurt and subsequently left school  reportedly to turn pro. A 2016 recruiting coup went bad when Zach Brown  a 7-foot center from Florida  was arrested on a robbery charge  then dropped. In August  Sidney Wilson  an incoming freshman from the Bronx  abruptly transferred to Connecticut. More recently  Mullin’s top-rated 2018 recruit  J’Raan Brooks  rescinded his commitment. It’s not too difficult to imagine what Mullin finds distasteful about a career fate hanging on the whims of teenagers and those — parents  friends  the shoe-company crowd — whispering in their ears. What’s to love? The game  he said. Always the game  and the gym. “I don’t really differentiate from big-time college basketball to any other kind of basketball ” Mullin said. “It’s basketball. It’s fundamentals and defense and shooting — they’re all the same. There are some new innovations  of course. But on the court  the things that win games are the same  and the things that lose games are the same. It looks a little different — the 3-point line — but we were averaging 120 points with the Warriors in 1990.” Can this old-school approach with an embrace of new curriculum work in a culture inhabited and largely dominated by verbose men with well-oiled shticks? Tariq Owens  a 6-11 redshirt junior from Maryland  who transferred to St. John’s from Tennessee upon Mullin’s arrival  had an ideal profile for St. John’s. His father  Renard  grew up in Queens during the Mullin era. “This was my dad’s dream school ” Owens said. “When we heard that Chris Mullin was getting the job  that helped a lot  the history of it all.” Ponds  a 6-1  flashy scoring guard from Brooklyn  chose St. John’s over its Big East rivals Providence and Creighton  becoming the highest-rated Red Storm player from New York City to stay home since Maurice Harkless  now with the Portland Trail Blazers  did it in 2011. Tom Konchalski  a Queens-based scout of high school players in the New York metropolitan area  said that although New York was “not quite the hotbed for talent it once was ” Mullin and his staff had done a reasonable job of establishing a recruiting base in New York while also looking elsewhere. Konchalski said that what has been a growth process for St. John’s overall student body — a significant expansion of on-campus housing — might have been detrimental to the basketball program. “Before they had dorms  they could give players a living stipend for an apartment  a used car  and that helped ” Konchalski said. “What they’re selling now is Chris Mullin and Madison Square Garden. Can they ever return to the glory days? I don’t know. But they could be a solid Big East program.” Who knows what is in store for college basketball with the F.B.I. prowling its back alleys? Who knows which programs may become toxic and what opportunities may arise for those who emerge unscathed? “Those sneaker companies have gotten much bigger  and they have a lot more power now ” Mullin said on a recent Friday  speaking about the latest crisis to envelop the sport. At the Garden the next day  Ponds and the Red Storm pushed Seton Hall to overtime before losing in front of a near-capacity crowd  the kind of recruit-friendly environment that moved Mullin to say  “Where else would you want to be on a Saturday afternoon?” In its finale at Carnesecca Arena last Wednesday  St. John’s outlasted Butler — a team it had lost to by 25 in late January — without the injured Ponds. That result piled onto the belief that the resurgence will carry into next season. In addition to the returning starters Owens  Marvin Clark II and Justin Simon  two promising transfers and one injured freshman will expand the depth chart  along with at least three new recruits. “Everyone knows we’ve been playing short  lost our point guard ” Owens said. “Even with that  we know we’ve been able to compete with the best teams in the country.” Cautious optimism would be the advised kind. Having caught the eye of professional scouts  Ponds is sure to explore declaring for the N.B.A. draft. And this being college basketball  every turned corner brings the possibility of a head-on collision. After the Seton Hall game  Coach Kevin Willard was peppered with questions about his program’s inclusion in reports of players from multiple top teams being paid. Drawing similar queries merely on the grounds of being in the same business  Mullin said  “I wouldn’t comment on any of that ” while adding that he “didn’t experience” such impropriety as a player. When Mullin was a freshman at St. John’s  Ron Linfonte began a 37-year run as the team’s trainer. Mullin is the sixth coach he has worked with since Carnesecca and  he said  the most adaptive. “I think the way this team has held together has been due to Chris ” he said. “I’ve seen coaches here  when the losing starts  they crunch the guys even more. Chris got a lot of this from Looie. With everything he’s been through  he knows how to reach them.” Linfonte has his own career dream  finishing with a Mullin-led flourish. “Having him hand me a Final Four ring ” he said. No harm in wishing upon St. John’s brightest star  who  in turn  would no doubt say: Hold on  slow down  one day at a time. The only certainty in this life  this game  is the gym.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/12/us/college-student-suicide-hamilton.html,His College Knew of His Despair. His Parents Didn’t  Until It Was Too Late. Advertisement Supported by None CLINTON  N.Y. — In the days after her son Graham hanged himself in his dormitory room at Hamilton College  Gina Burton went about settling his affairs in a blur of efficiency  her grief tinged with a nagging sense that something did not add up. She fielded requests and sympathy notes from the college  promising the dean of students a copy of his obituary “so you can see how special Hamilton was to him.” This was why his suicide “makes no sense ” she added in a puzzled aside. The next day  Ms. Burton accepted condolences from the college president  and assured him “how right a choice Hamilton was” for her son. But two weeks later  she read her son’s journal and everything changed. Mr. Burton  a sophomore  wrote that he was flunking three of his four classes and called himself a “failure with no life prospects.” He had struggled to sleep  missed classes  turned in assignments late. The college had known of his difficulty  he wrote  but had been slow to offer help and understanding. “Would you care to shed some light on this?” Ms. Burton asked in an angry email sent at 2:53 a.m. to the academic dean  with copies to the president and the dean of students. “If this is what drove Graham  I don’t think I’ll be able to cope.” Every year  parents send their children to college  trusting that they will be well  or that word will come if they are not. Ms. Burton had lived every parent’s nightmare: a child flunking out  sinking into despair  his parents the last to know. Her discovery set off a wave of pain and soul-searching but also a campaign to strip away some of the veils of confidentiality that colleges say protect the privacy and autonomy of students who are learning to be adults. None None “I think everybody should be on notice that schools can’t hide their head in the sand ” a mental health lawyer  Carolyn Reinach Wolf  said. “They can’t say  ‘Students are on loan to us.’” Professors at Hamilton College  in upstate New York  had expressed concerns about Mr. Burton for much of the fall term and knew he was in deep distress  according to a report on his death that was shown to The New York Times. More than a month before his death  his adviser  Maurice Isserman  wrote the academic dean the strongest of many warnings: “Obviously what’s happening here is a complete crash and burn. I don’t know what the procedures/rules are for contacting parents but if this was my kid  I’d want to know.” Professor Isserman struck at the heart of what mattered to the Burtons: whether the college had a responsibility to tell them what it knew. College officials say they are constrained by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act  or Ferpa  a federal law governing student privacy  in reaching out to parents. A Hamilton official cited it at a recent student assembly meeting  when students asked about the Burtons’ contention that they had not been told of their son’s troubles. The law views students as adults and bars parents from even the most basic student records  like a transcript  without their child’s consent. There are exceptions: Colleges can release any student record to parents if the student signs a consent  if the college knows that a parent claims the child as a dependent on tax forms  or in a health or safety emergency. Even so  federal law allows colleges to use their discretion. They are allowed  but not required  to release the records or let a family member know if a student is suicidal. Colleges use the law not only to protect students’ privacy but also to shield the college from conflict with parents and other forces in society  said Brett Sokolow  a risk management consultant to universities. “There is an ethos of maintaining privacy and confidentiality — which sometimes is very beneficial ” Mr. Sokolow said. “But when somebody’s dead  do you wish you’d worked to maintain their privacy  or do you wish you’d worked to keep them alive?” As colleges contend with how involved to be in students’ lives  parents  too  often struggle with their responsibility to recognize when their children need help. Some Hamilton administrators said that they did not want to encourage helicopter parenting  and that parents were sometimes part of the problem. “There’s a concern that if the school has too low a threshold for contacting family or suggesting a student take a leave of absence  it will actually discourage kids from coming forward for help ” said Dr. Victor Schwartz  the chief medical officer at the Jed Foundation  an advocacy group for student mental health. “So you’re basically walking a tightrope.” No matter how close parents are to their children  there is so much  especially of their internal lives  that they may not know about them. Many parents are astonished to realize that they may never see a transcript of their child’s grades. If they are lucky  the college might send home a congratulatory note  to be tacked onto the refrigerator  about the child making the dean’s list. But parents  often referred to as “authorized payers” on tuition bills  are not likely to get a similar notification if a child is flunking  or seeking help for distress. Even when the suicide threat is explicit  colleges have been reluctant to bring in parents. In the spring of 2016  Olivia Kong  a junior at the University of Pennsylvania  had been barely sleeping  worried about not being able to drop a class she thought she would fail. None That weekend  she went home to her parents  who live nearby in Philadelphia  and spoke to the same on-call psychiatrist. In his report  the psychiatrist wrote  “I offered that the cost of E.R. visit is likely less than cost of funeral arrangements.” He added  “Said that she had actually planned to return to campus Sunday and kill self.” Ms. Kong did return to campus  and her parents went to check on her at about midnight Sunday  meeting her outside her dorm. Her mother felt her daughter’s forehead for fever and gave her some dumplings she had cooked for her. The next morning  April 11  Ms. Kong walked into the dark tunnel of a commuter rail station and lay down on the tracks. The conductor could not stop in time. “We still feel shocked ” her mother said last month in their lawyer’s office in Philadelphia. “The university  they know everything  but they didn’t tell us anything.” A spokesman for the university  Ron Ozio  declined to comment. The warning signs in Mr. Burton’s case were murkier  all the more reason  Ms. Wolf  the mental health lawyer  said  that colleges should have a clear protocol for responding. Mr. Burton’s father  Stewart  an investment banker  and mother  Gina  who stayed home to raise their two boys and did volunteer work  had taken him to Hamilton with high hopes his freshman year  making the five-hour drive from their home in Toronto. His nickname was Savage  and friends gravitated toward his humor and nonconformist style. He embraced his Canadian origin by wearing a plaid jacket and a red maple-leaf cap. In his last weeks  one friend recalled  he brought down the house at a student cafe with a hilariously dreadful rendition of the indie rock song “In the Aeroplane Over the Sea.” He spent hours playing guitar and talking about life with his close friend  Max Phillipps  who lived across the hall their sophomore year. Mr. Phillipps recalled that Mr. Burton seemed extraordinarily creative at the time  writing plays and short stories and filling journals. But he also wore the same clothes every day and had erratic sleeping habits. “His expression was pretty melancholy ” Mr. Phillipps said. “I had to work to make him laugh.” In hindsight  Mr. Phillipps added  “There were definitely signs.” Some professors thought so  too. The report on Mr. Burton’s death showed that three of his four professors  his adviser and the academic dean had exchanged emails about his frequent absences from classes. The three professors submitted four academic warnings. Mr. Burton sometimes replied to their emails  opening with a polite “Hello ” always sounding distracted. The youngest  Anne Feltovich  a Latin teacher in her 30s  was the most persistent and appeared the most empathetic. “Dear Graham ” she emailed him on Oct. 24  “You’ve dropped off the radar. How are you doing?” Later  she offered to give him an incomplete and to tutor him in Ovid and Livy by Skype over break. “Sending you support and strength from afar ” she wrote. His adviser  Professor Isserman  at first dismissed Mr. Burton’s inattention to his studies as “his M.O.  I’m afraid.” But he soon escalated his warnings. On Nov. 2  Professor Isserman wrote to the academic dean  Vivyan Adair  that he had not been able to reach Mr. Burton  who he said was going through “a complete crash and burn.” About two weeks later  Mr. Burton wrote to Professor Feltovich that he had been meeting with the dean. Asked about Mr. Burton this past week  Professor Adair said in an email that she had urged him “to speak to his parents about his academic issues and to seek help from the counseling center if he felt depressed.” But she said that when she met with him  he appeared engaged in college  in his writing and in his social life. “My job was to work with him to resolve his academic issues  which I did ” Professor Adair said. “If I had perceived that he was at risk  I certainly would have taken additional steps.” The report said there was no policy or practice that prevented staff from contacting the parents. But it said  “The pervasive impression of faculty and staff is that the college’s overall philosophy is to treat students as adults and allow them to take ownership of any issues they are facing.” At about 1:30 a.m. on a day during finals week  Mr. Phillipps came back to his dorm from studying and found Mr. Burton wanting to talk. But Mr. Phillipps had a final exam in the morning and asked if it could wait. When he returned from his final  at about 11 a.m. on Dec. 14  he opened Mr. Burton’s door and found him hanged by his belt  his feet inches from the floor. “Every day of my life I think about it ” said Mr. Phillipps  who was given Mr. Burton’s guitar. “I do feel guilt at not being there at 1:30 a.m.  maybe keeping him alive for another day.” Four business cards were found on Mr. Burton’s desk: one for someone at the counseling center  two from the academic dean  with the names of psychiatrists written on them  and one from a peer counselor. He had never been placed on the college’s list of “Students of Concern ” the report said. “He was not on anyone’s radar  including the counseling center  other than through academic warnings  and had never been brought to the weekly S.O.C. meeting for discussion.” The Burtons said they deserved at least the chance to try to save their son. “I can assure you that I would have been far more aggressive in getting Graham the help he needed ” Ms. Burton wrote to Hamilton’s president  David Wippman  after reading her son’s diary. The Burtons were not totally unaware. In her emails to the college after his death  Ms. Burton said that she had made doctor’s appointments to look into his insomnia and that she had been talking to him about visiting the Amen Clinics  a psychiatric center  for brain scans. But she said he had talked about his classes and was looking forward to the future: going on a family ski trip  buying a used Subaru  getting a summer job. Still grieving more than a year after their son’s death  the Burtons wrote an open letter to the Hamilton College community in March. Noting a second suicide nine months after their son’s  they said  “We do not believe the college has done enough in the wake of our son’s death to safeguard other students.” Students shared the letter via email. One  Ian Lunn  said he thought the wall between the administration and parents was too rigid. “A lot of people feel  sure  tell my parents  I just don’t want to die ” said Mr. Lunn  who is doing an independent study of suicide on campus. Drew McArthur  a classmate and friend of Mr. Burton’s  said he would resist signing a blanket waiver of his privacy. But  he added  “I would sign something that said  ‘In the event that people are worried about you.’ That may be subjective  but I would trust the college with that.” The report recommended that the college adopt a more centralized case management system for students in distress. It also recommended “workshops on empathy.” None College officials declined to comment on Mr. Burton’s death  but said they had taken steps recommended by the report. They created a position  the associate dean of student support  filled by someone with mental health credentials. Faculty members are being trained to help recognize students in distress  with a separate committee following up with students of concern. The college also formed a coalition of faculty  staff and students  led by the associate dean  to try to reduce stress at the college. Despite the changes  faculty members still are expected to contact a dean  not parents directly  when they are concerned about students  Terry Martinez  the dean of students  said. In their open letter to the college  the Burtons asked for a mandatory process to notify parents “in circumstances where a professor  coach  adviser or other community member has concerns about a student’s well-being.” They could not get over not knowing what the college had known. “The question that will haunt us forever is why didn’t she call us?” Ms. Burton wrote in an email to the college president  invoking the academic dean who had met with their son. Hamilton was just a five-hour drive away  she wrote. They would have gone the same day  reassured him. They would have taken him home. Susan Beachy contributed research.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/18/nyregion/african-immigrants-bronx-community-college.html,African Immigrants Find an Open Door at a Bronx College Advertisement Supported by None If African students at Bronx Community College need encouragement  they need only look so far as the president. None None Administrators at the college say that the African students tend to earn better grades  in less time  than their classmates. And they do so in the face of everything from being demonized and dismissed by immigration hard-liners to being called hut-dwellers by the ignorant. Yet they are believers in the American dream  even if some Americans don’t believe in them. “They come here like sponges and want to soak up the knowledge ” said Dr. Isekenegbe  who was appointed president of Bronx Community College three years ago. “I have a lot of responsibility to them to be a role model. If you work hard and do the things you are supposed to  while there is no utopia in this world  this place is the closest to one. Despite all this talk  this is a country that if you have a good education  you will have the opportunity  someone will open the door. It’s important they see it is possible to ascend in American society.” This is not hype  but an acknowledgment of a community that has been growing in plain sight in neighborhoods like Morrisania and Highbridge. Some have escaped upheaval  like Paulin Dongomale  an engineering student who was forced to flee the Central African Republic. Others come right out of high school  joining fathers who arrived years before to work as cabdrivers or deliverymen to support their families back home. The experience can be life-changing  as Godwin Boaful discovered  when the young Ghanaian went from the Bronx to Brown University  where he earned his undergraduate degree in chemistry before entering Brown’s medical school. What they share is a college where they have been made to feel not just welcome  but an important part of campus life. The college has been setting up programs to help them adjust culturally  if not academically  while also offering them chances to develop outside the classroom. “If you engage with the campus community  doors will open for you ” Dr. Isekenegbe said. “If all you do is take the 4 train  run to class and run back  you’re not going to be successful. You have to become engaged  know your professors and join clubs. It expands your network and develops leadership.” Many of the African students — like other immigrants — have focused on science and technology  as well as programs in nursing that provide skills that are in demand  especially in the Bronx  where the health care industry is the largest employer. But in more recent years there has been an uptick in those studying political science or human services  giving them skills that are applicable in their home countries. Bright Igbinigun  who in addition to his studies and work as a Pentecostal pastor  recently published a book of poems titled “I Must Return Home.” He said his experience at Bronx Community helped him realize the importance of civic engagement. Originally from Nigeria  Mr. Igbinigun  24  is studying political science with an eye on law school. “I have a great passion for the situation in my country  Nigeria ” he said. “There is a lot going on there politically and economically  and I would like to go home and help reshape the situation. This is not something just for Nigerians  but to encourage everyone in the diaspora  whether they are Pakistani or Dominican  to realize the importance of service.” Victoria McEwen learned those lessons even before she moved to the Bronx in 2010 to join her husband. She was born in Sierra Leone  where civil war upended the family’s life. Now at Bronx Community  which her husband also attended  she is studying human services. “I got my lessons from my parents during the war ” Ms. McEwen  44  said. “My mother helped others  and our house became a refugee center. People would come over and we’d share our food. Before I came here  I wanted to study accounting. But the desire has grown in me to help people. Looking at the homeless in this country  or just at what people have to go through  my passion to help has increased.” What has also grown is her determination not to be distracted or discouraged by off-the-cuff remarks from President Trump. Besides  she’s too busy studying. “That’s his opinion ” she said. “It doesn’t matter. I know why I am here. If he checked what he was saying  he would know why America is what it is. Why it is full of diversity. What I say to other Africans here is just be focused. Know who you are. Stand up for what you believe.” Follow David Gonzalez on Twitter: @dgbxny None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,students and education
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/01/sports/ncaafootball/florida-state-football.html,Football Favoritism at F.S.U.: The Price One Teacher Paid Advertisement Supported by None TALLAHASSEE  Fla. — As the Florida State University football team was marching to a national title in the fall of 2013  the school was investigating allegations of academic favoritism involving a half-dozen of its leading players  including one who scored the winning touchdown in the championship game. The inquiry  previously unreported  stemmed from a complaint by a teaching assistant who said she felt pressured to give special breaks to athletes in online hospitality courses on coffee  tea and wine  where some handed in plagiarized work and disregarded assignments and quizzes. The assistant  a 47-year-old doctoral student named Christina Suggs  provided emails and other evidence in late August 2013 to the Florida State inspector general  an independent office. But her case was soon taken over by the university’s attorney. None It is unclear if any of the conduct Ms. Suggs complained about resulted in athletes being improperly eligible to play. In a statement  the university said an outside consultant it hired to investigate found no wrongdoing. It refused to release any more information  saying that to do so would jeopardize the privacy of the students involved. Even so  two things are certain: By the end of 2013  Florida State had tightened standards for the online hospitality courses. And Ms. Suggs had lost her job and left the school. None None None Ms. Suggs wrote that Mr. Wilder “should have done the work like everyone else” and objected to granting him special treatment  telling a colleague  “I am not offering this opportunity to other students.” The colleague agreed  summing up their mutual concern about Professor Bonn: “Trying to put a stop to his favoritism for athletes once and for all.” None “It was a huge heartache for her ” said Barbara Davis  a fellow doctoral student and close friend of Ms. Suggs. “She told me how there had been tremendous pressure on her to pass these football players  even though they didn’t deserve it.” In June 2013  administrators at Florida State’s Dedman School of Hospitality circulated a memo to teaching assistants. The school’s online courses in “beverage management ” the memo noted  were popular with “a large number of student athletes” who needed to be tracked closely. “Like the on-ground classes  we’re asked to review athletes’ progress on a regular basis and report how they’re doing to their academic advisers ” the memo said. None He also shared a Tallahassee defense lawyer with Mr. Wilder and other football players in trouble  the lawyer  R. Timothy Jansen  represented the professor when his second wife filed for divorce in December 2012 and obtained a restraining order  which was later lifted with no admission of wrongdoing by Professor Bonn. Professor Bonn’s interactions with Ms. Suggs initially were positive  he praised her work incorporating the concept of sustainability into a course on coffee and tea  according to emails among staff members at Dedman in May 2013. Ms. Suggs  a single mother working from home so she could raise her young son  also received good reviews from Dedman’s director  Jane Ohlin  who called her “absolutely fabulous” and said her “work ethic is above reproach.” By midsummer  though  Ms. Suggs was growing frustrated. She said she felt pressure “to pad grades for the football players  and I told her I thought that was common practice ” said Phil Suggs  her estranged husband. “But she said  ‘Not with me. If they don’t make it  they don’t make it ’” he said. After a defensive end on the team  Chris Casher  handed in plagiarized work  Ms. Suggs alerted a program associate in the office  Aiden Sizemore  who sent an email to Professor Bonn saying the player had “copied every portion of his project” with no citations or sources listed. Professor Bonn allowed Mr. Casher to redo the work  explaining to him the meaning of paraphrase  that copied text needed quotation marks “before the first word and after the last word ” and that sources had to be listed at the end. None Another player turned in writing of his own that was barely grade-school level. “Brazilian coffee is one of few places that has a carnival and the coffee place a major role just as much as the dancing and the food ” he wrote. Several players were allowed to make up missed assignments and quizzes long past the deadlines  even though course policy said it was “unacceptable to wait until the last week of class” to request it  on a couple of occasions  Professor Bonn deducted points for lateness. Neither Professor Bonn nor any of the players responded to requests for comment for this article. It was Mr. Wilder’s insistence that he should get a grade of B that seemed to have caused the most consternation. In his email to Professor Bonn  he claimed he had submitted work that he had not been credited for  while also acknowledging missing a handful of assignments and quizzes. In response to the professor’s query  Ms. Suggs wrote that she “carefully reviewed James Wilder’s grades and can assure you that the work he missed is because he did not do it or did not turn it in.” She added  ”It is my opinion that he should have done the work like everyone else.” Ms. Suggs had already graded Mr. Wilder’s final project  a PowerPoint presentation comparing coffee in Argentina and Kenya  which was incomplete. But Professor Bonn instructed her to allow him to submit missing sections and set a new deadline  prompting her to seek guidance from Mr. Sizemore  her colleague who had expressed concern about Professor Bonn’s “favoritism for athletes.” One issue was that students were not allowed to make up missed assignments without a documented excuse  such as a medical problem  approved by the university. Mr. Sizemore replied that he would consult Ms. Ohlin  the school’s director  “as this is above both of our pay grades LOL.” When Ms. Suggs had not heard back later that evening  she reached out to Mr. Sizemore again. “I don’t want Dr. Bonn to get mad at me for not responding to him. I also don’t want him mad at me for not doing what he says ” she wrote. “I really want to keep my job.” “Go ahead with what Dr. Bonn wants to do ” Mr. Sizemore replied  “and just let me know if he tries to have anything else opened without documentation.” Ms. Suggs gave Mr. Wilder the new deadline  but he missed that one  too  and another  before eventually turning in the material several days later. It is unclear if Mr. Wilder got his B. But Professor Bonn forwarded his work to Ms. Suggs  saying  “It looks great.” Although the university maintained that Ms. Suggs’s complaint was without merit  it clearly believed there were problems with the online classes at Dedman. It canceled some of them in the fall of 2013 and revamped the distance learning program  in the face of concern about “academic dishonesty” and other matters  according to emails among university administrators. In addition  Professor Bonn  who had run the distance learning program since 2009  stepped aside from that role. “The one thing I desperately need is for there not to be any ‘drama’ around these online classes ” Ms. Ohlin  the director of Dedman  emailed a colleague in October 2013. “We have problems with plagiarism. Problems with the answers to tests” being accessible. As for the complaint about Professor Bonn and the football players  the university said  “The decision to rework the online courses to ensure they were academically rigorous enough to support the College of Business degree had nothing to do with Ms. Suggs or her report.” None “Clearly  there are academic integrity issues here that apply to N.C.A.A. rules  but the key is whether it affected certification of eligibility ” Mr. Gurney said  regarding the concerns raised by Ms. Suggs. “I would suspect that it is an impermissible academic assistance problem  but I’d need more information.” As the 2013 fall semester came to a close and the Seminoles were preparing for the championship game  Ms. Suggs — who already had two master’s degrees — was informed that her job as a teaching assistant would not be renewed because she did not have enough business school credits. In an email to the inspector general  Ms. Suggs said that she believed she had lost her job “due to this unfortunate circumstance with Dr. Bonn and the investigation into the football players.” Ms. Suggs decided to leave Florida State  after five years  with an education specialist degree — one step short of her doctorate. In her email to the inspector general  she added that she was “hoping just to put all of Florida State University behind me as I move forward with my life.” Friends said her decision to leave took an enormous toll. “I can’t stress enough how important this Ph.D. was to her ” said Melissa Isaak  another of her close friends  adding that next to raising her son  obtaining the advanced degree “was the single most important thing in her life.” In the months that followed  in deteriorating health and deeply in debt with student loans  Ms. Suggs struggled to cobble together a steady income from online teaching jobs. She had back surgery in October 2014 and returned to her tiny rented condo in Panama City Beach  Fla.  to recuperate. Not long after  Ms. Suggs lay down for a nap while her mother took her son out to a restaurant. They returned to find her unresponsive  a trickle of blood seeping from her nose. The medical examiner determined that she had died accidentally from a toxic combination of prescription medicines for pain  anxiety and depression.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/education/learning/act-sat-college-entrance-exam.html,For the ACT and the SAT  Pencils No Longer Required  but Sometimes Necessary Advertisement Supported by None For the first time this Tuesday  the 70-member junior class of Chisholm High School in Enid  Okla.  will sit for the SAT college entrance exam  but almost all the students will be clicking through Chromebooks instead of blackening bubbles with a No. 2 pencil. One hundred fifteen miles east of Enid  the Tulsa  Okla.  schools were also invited this year to administer an online version of the SAT  the exam that Tulsa’s 1 700 juniors must take. The district chose paper and pencil. Like Chisholm  Tulsa already gives all its end-of-year tests online. But this is the first year that SAT scores must be reported to the state for Oklahoma’s school accountability report cards  and principals just did not want to risk an internet problem or power outage  explained Erin Lester  director of assessment. There are other challenges for this urban district  too  like how to give an online test to those likely to be in jail  juvenile detention or a mental health facility  a number that could range from dozens to more than 100 on testing day. “Some of the jails don’t even allow computers with internet accessibility ” Ms. Lester said. “We wanted to be equitable.” Long in the works  the digital transition by the two college testing companies is taking a few more cautious steps forward this year. But with 29 states  the District of Columbia and many of the largest cities giving the standardized exams to all juniors  the complexity of the task has never been greater. None None “The challenges I often hear are about the entire state having enough laptops for every single junior and senior to take an assessment on the same day ” said Angie McAllister  ACT senior vice president for research. “ACT is responding to what our customers are asking us for  and today  they are still saying we want to do most of it on paper.” ACT’s archrival  the College Board  are offering digital versions of the school-day SAT in Oklahoma and Ohio this month. Altogether  about 100 schools will take either the SAT or Preliminary SAT exams online  said Zach Goldberg  a spokesman. But it  too  has had stumbles and resistance. “We will continue to work with educators to navigate the unique challenges of responsibly delivering digital assessments while safeguarding access and equity ” Jeremy Singer  the chief operating officer  said in a statement. Digital testing offers the potential for lower cost  instant results and more accurate scoring. Eliminating test booklets and answer sheets provides greater security from test theft  a serious concern after major cheating scandals in the United States and abroad. An increasing share of professional  licensing and postgraduate exams are digital-only  including the GRE  MCAT and GMAT. Digital literacy in schools was a core goal of the federal No Child Left Behind Act of 2001  which mandated annual testing of schoolchildren grades three through eight and in high school to hold schools accountable. The Common Core academic standards  released in 2010 and accepted by most states  called for state accountability tests to be administered online. But developing an online version of a high-stakes standardized test requires exhaustive studies of such factors as laptop scrolling speeds  screen loading of various equipment and fine-grained statistical comparisons of scores  Ms. McAllister said. Test administration poses its own challenges. In South Carolina last year  the first statewide mandatory online ACT exam was marred by technical difficulties  forcing some schools to administer makeup tests and delaying some score reports. Mr. Colby blamed a nationwide outage beyond ACT’s control  but Ryan Brown  an Education Department spokesman  said the state encouraged districts to seek waivers for paper tests this year  and many did. “Frankly  we don’t trust ACT’s capacity to test an entire state online ” he said. ACT adapted by requiring a new test setup this year. The approach  known as proctor caching  is in place in suburban Edmond  Okla.  where 1 692 juniors are taking the ACT online for the first time at three high schools and an alternative academy. Each school has a dedicated server that downloads and administers the test to individual students’ work stations  thus avoiding web-related problems. “We have not had one phone call from a parent concerned or questioning ” said Angela Mills Grunewald  associate superintendent. “I think online testing is so much the norm that it’s not a concern.” But Oklahoma City opted for the paper SAT this year  because the city does not yet have enough equipment and its older buildings are prone to power and network failures. The 2013 debut of Oklahoma’s online statewide testing is remembered as a debacle. “Many students already experience anxiety while taking exams such as the SAT  and disruptions in testing may further increase this anxiety for students ” said Beth Harrison  chief communications officer for the Oklahoma City schools. It’s not just students who are anxious  said Thomas Tucker  superintendent of the Princeton City School District in Cincinnati  which plans to give the SAT online on Tuesday. “When you change from one mode of test administration to another  scores typically drop — we know that for a fact ” said Mr. Tucker  who serves on a College Board advisory panel. Adept as this generation is online  teenagers are most at ease using phones  not keyboards  he said. Though scores tend to rebound later  Mr. Tucker said many of his colleagues do not want even a temporary score drop on their watch. “They don’t want to bite the bullet ” he said. Closer study has shown that scores drop only among students who do not use computers for everyday schoolwork  said Tracy Weeks  executive director of the State Educational Technology Directors Association. The College Board and ACT emphasize the practice value of their online exams in earlier grades  as well as their free online test prep: The College Board promotes the score-boosting power of its partner Khan Academy  commonly used in school and after-school curriculums  while ACT this spring began its own ACT Academy online test prep. Nevertheless  many students still feel more confident with pencil and paper. Bryce Kessler  a senior at Princeton High School  who hopes to study musical theater  said he took the online SAT at school last year but did better on the pencil-and paper Saturday ACT for which he had been practicing for years. “It was kind of disorienting to me ” he said of the digital format. “I know a lot of people who did not finish or said they only got halfway.” At least one test coach  ArborBridge  is urging its clients to avoid online tests if they have the option  saying too little is known about the testing setup and interface. “No one wants to be a guinea pig ” said Megan Stubbendeck  ArborBridge’s senior director of instruction. That prospect apparently does not faze the juniors in Enid. “I personally am nervous ” said Kassidy Diel  junior class secretary  who is aiming for Oklahoma State University and a career in veterinary medicine. But she admitted that is just her mind-set about tests. “Everybody has taken at least one big test online ” she said. “I think they know what to expect.” None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,students and education
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/education/learning/tests-act-sat.html,Here’s What You Need to Know About Online Testing for the ACT and SAT Advertisement Supported by None Q: What kind of computers are required for an online test? None What are the safeguards against crashes  slow-loading tests or lost answers? ACT’s test administrator  Pearson Assessment  uses proctor caching: Each testing location has its own local server  which downloads the test  delivers it to individual students and collects the answers before returning them to Pearson’s home server. Once the tests are returned  they disappear from local computers. The SAT’s administrator  AIR Assessment  uses a proprietary browser with built-in redundancies  including a diagnostic tool that helps schools assess the health of their network and how many testers it can support at one time. Responses are saved on multiple servers  so if the connection is disrupted students can log on elsewhere and pick up where they left off. None Adaptive tests adjust the level of questioning according to how the test taker performs on prior questions  so that low scorers are asked fewer of the hardest questions and high scorers don’t need to waste as much time on easy ones. That kind of test can provide a more detailed picture of what students have mastered. It also means test takers get different questions in a different order from one another and from previous exams that may have been leaked or stolen. Does anyone use these adaptive tests?  The GRE and G.M.A.T. graduate exams are adaptive tests  as is the Smarter Balanced test some states use to measure Common Core skills in grades 3 to 11. Language placement exams are often adaptive  as are licensing exams for pharmacists  accountants  paramedics and other professions. None What’s the holdup on going adaptive? Just to go online has required exhaustive studies and statistical analysis to ensure comparability of a paper exam score with one from a computer  time the test loading and scrolling speeds of various laptops  and assure that computerized testing doesn’t work to the advantage of some groups of students over others. Beyond that  adaptive testing also demands a much larger store of potential questions. None If the school opts for online testing  only students granted special accommodations for a disability can take it on paper. But schools may opt for a mixed mode of ACT testing  which would allow students to choose. Digital ACT and SAT tests are given on more than one day. Are they different tests  and if not  what’s to prevent students sharing questions and answers online? Both companies declined to answer  citing test security  but said they take many steps to protect against cheating and ensure a fair testing environment. Is scratch paper allowed? Does the online test have any useful features that paper tests don’t? Both tests allow pencils and scratch paper. Both tests allow you to bookmark items to return to later and have a countdown clock to keep track of time left in the section. The ACT lets you cross off answers you want to eliminate  and it marks unanswered questions with an orange dot  while the SAT provides electronic scratch paper and the ability to highlight passages.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/05/opinion/college-applications-stress.html,Why Applying to College Is So Confusing Advertisement Supported by On Campus None The annual college applications frenzy is upon us — a season when high school students agonize over G.P.A.s and personal essays  hoping and praying that they will stand out among throngs of applicants. The anxiety among applicants about how to present themselves to universities is very visible online. Websites have sprung up to advise students on  say  whether teacher recommendations make a difference or whether to write about money in a college essay. One website  College Confidential  has offered a seminar in which you “learn what admission officials discuss behind closed doors” but “may not tell you in the information session.” Desperate applicants ask other site visitors — complete strangers — to “chance” them  or estimate the likelihood they will be admitted to their dream college. This degree of bewilderment is troubling  but not surprising. None None One of those institutions is seeking  in part  to represent the population of New York. The other is looking for the most extraordinary students in the country. Both make admission decisions accordingly. Mission statements don’t necessarily make it easier for students to understand the nuts and bolts of admissions  but they are absolutely vital. A school’s admissions policy must flow from its mission. But by and large  colleges aren’t doing a good enough job explaining to applicants how admissions choices stem from their policy. While most colleges list some of the factors they consider in admission — such as leadership and involvement in extracurricular activities — they need to go further to explain how applicant characteristics are assessed and weighted. Admissions officers will readily point out that complete transparency is not possible — and that’s true. Colleges that explicitly state their preferences for under-represented racial groups  for example  risk running afoul of the Supreme Court  and in some cases  state prohibitions. None To be clear  these aren’t questions for the candidates themselves to answer. They are among the questions that the admissions officers ask themselves about prospective students based on their applications. Applicants  for their part  are left to wonder how Harvard admissions officers might infer the answers and what the right answers might be. And further  how important are these questions relative to more traditional factors  such as grades  test scores and extracurricular activities? Likewise  the University of California lists intellectual curiosity as a desirable applicant characteristic. That seems reasonable  but how is it evaluated? The university also considers disabilities  difficult personal and family situations  and low income  among other criteria. How much do these factors count? Do students score points for a parental divorce or a childhood illness? None None How could admissions offices be more open about how they choose? They could start by publishing vignettes to illustrate how admissions decisions are made  spell out why certain kinds of applicant profiles do or don’t make the grade  and describe how they identify talented students who fall short in terms of grades or test scores. Descriptions of the kinds of complex deliberations conducted by real admissions committees would be enlightening to both applicants and their families. Colleges don’t need to tell all. But a more comprehensive explanation of what drives their choices would go a long way toward lifting the veil from a system that many regard as an impenetrable mystery.

Advertisement Supported by Letters To the Editor: None Although colleges pretend they are dealing with a 17-year-old who is capable of making this decision on his or her own  that is simply not the case. My meltdown was preceded by my trying to print out our financial aid awards  which are sent only to the student. The meltdown hit when I realized that one of the schools only admitted her for the spring semester (January)  and for the fall semester she is admitted to its travel program  which costs $34 799! For one semester. None None To the Editor: The college admissions process was an emotional roller coaster. Going through the process of compiling my accomplishments opened up insecurities. My peers and I have deemed sites like College Confidential extremely toxic. Seeing that people with higher qualifications did not get into certain schools stirred up doubts such as  “What chance do I have  if they couldn’t even get in?” I’m surrounded by people who are top tier in academics  outstanding volunteers  skilled musicians and athletes  and leaders in extracurriculars at a highly competitive school. But many of us didn’t get into the schools we dreamed of. While growing up  there was an emphasis on being well-rounded individuals  but it seems colleges are becoming more selective in recruiting people with strengths in a certain area. Then there’s the discussion of race. I’m an Asian-American  and we’ve become a huge overachieving force in education  yet many of us aren’t able to get into schools we would otherwise qualify for based on merit. ZOE IMANSJAH  ARCADIA  CALIF. To the Editor: As a parent who is one year out from my son’s college admissions process  I offer these insights. First  do not encourage the concept of a “first choice” school. My son applied to six schools  any of which he would have been happy to attend. When he got into three of the six  there was no angst about not getting into a “first choice ” just an evaluation of what would be the best fit for his goals. Second  ditch the obsession with name-brand East Coast schools. I’m an Ivy grad living on the West Coast with a high-level academic position. I work with successful people who have attended an incredible gamut of universities. They are where they are because of passion and persistence  not where they went to school. Finally  even if your kid is going to her or his dream school  there will be bumps. High school to college is a huge transition. Getting into the best or right school does not change the reality of finding yourself living with a group of strangers with less structure than ever before in your life. None To the Editor: Of all the stressful aspects of the college application process  the one causing the most anxiety for me as a parent was exposure to college consultants. I participated in free introductory seminars that left me with a niggling fear that I would be doing my son a disservice if I didn’t hire an expert to review his essay  devise a strategy and manage all aspects of his application. Luckily  my son had the good sense not to succumb to the hype. He was determined to do it himself  with support from Khan Academy test prep  his school counselor  and friends and family who expressed faith in his ability. Now that he has been accepted to all of his top-choice schools  he can enjoy a sense of accomplishment and attend his dream school  an accomplishment that is all his own. BETH BRODSKY  BRONX To the Editor: Alas  I am unable to say what works and what does not in the college admissions process because my fate is to wait. I applied to one school early decision (Stanford). I got deferred  so I had to wait for the final (negative) decision. Additionally  I was wait-listed from my next top three schools (U.C. Berkeley  Dartmouth  Cornell). The wait list (or a deferment) is rather like purgatory. You’re qualified enough to not be rejected  but not good enough to be accepted. So you wait  even though you’ve already been waiting for three-plus months. And while you do so  you wonder what you could have done better to be admitted. Would higher grades or scores have helped? Should I have pushed my athletics and extracurriculars more? Was my essay too flat? I will never know. Nor can we do anything now  except send our spring grades and write an update letter to the admissions committee. So we wait. None To the Editor: It is ugly out there. Despite our best efforts to start the message of “where you go is not who you’ll be” very early (ninth grade)  a motivated  high-achieving student will body-block you if you suggest restraint. My daughter heard about a Postal Service subscription that allows you to view a photo online of each piece of mail that is going to be delivered to your house on that day. I am not making this up. She knew exactly how much the piece of mail from her top-choice school would weigh if a rejection and how much if an acceptance (thanks  College Confidential). None None To the Editor: As a parent of four college graduates  and as a high school educator for over three decades (17 years as head of school)  I have a simple suggestion: Get rid of “early decision” and use only “early action.” The former requires a student to commit to attend in advance of admittance  the latter does not. For a senior in the fall  such a forced commitment is like a proposal of marriage  yet six months later  the senior might have fallen in love with another school. The only benefit from early decision over early action redounds to the college or university  looking to boost its “yield” (percentage of “admits” who attend). There is no benefit to the student  who deserves more freedom of choice in this major decision. JAMES S. BERKMAN  BOSTON To the Editor: While I have read countless New York Times articles on the college admissions process  they did not prepare me for the results: five wait lists and 14 rejections  in addition to acceptance at my safety school. With college admissions being a world of expensive consultants  prep courses for SATs and competition with students attending private schools  as a low-income student in an Alabama public high school  in many ways I didn’t have a shot at all. The Common Application itself was a foreign land to me and my classmates  although my 98th percentile test scores allowed me a place in the top handful of my class. While I will be attending the University of Alabama in the fall  it still pains me to think of the life-changing possibilities had I been admitted to Northwestern or Georgetown. I do not know how the admissions process could be remedied  but with legacy admissions and athletic preferences  this will only become an increasingly divisive issue. None To the Editor: I wish I had realized sooner that where you go to college is not nearly as important as what you do when you get there. I think a lot of us seniors worried that we’d end up at a safety school without considering the benefits. If I could get a do-over  I would have looked at more schools where I could have been a big fish in a small pond and taken more leadership opportunities  instead of only focusing on a school’s pedigree. AMELIA REUBEN  WASHINGTON The writer will be in the class of 2022 at American University. To the Editor: America’s college admissions process parallels one of the great problems of the country — too much unreliable information. Colleges  faced with low-value standardized tests  many more applicants than openings  and inflated grades  make up arbitrary criteria for discriminating among students. There simply is not enough data in a standard application — and the time allotted to reviewing it by an admissions officer — to make an honest  meritocratic decision. Students  faced with a seemingly arbitrary admissions process whose criteria vary from year to year  attempt to do it all. Instead of excelling in one or two extracurriculars  or demonstrating significant competence in one field of knowledge  today’s students attempt to cover all bases. The result is an often soulless pursuit of trophies and  ultimately  a declining value in being randomly admitted to highly selective schools. Perhaps that is  ultimately  the best preparation for life. None To the Editor: As a sophomore at Columbia  I vividly remember the existential dread of college admissions. A formidable proportion of my classmates are legacy students and/or from families in the top 1 percent. As a first-generation student  I am constantly amazed by the opportunities here  and I wish admissions committees would end legacy and financial preferences to allow more working-class families like mine to experience a life-changing education. For our society to progress  we need to democratize education  not further incentivize pay-to-play agendas. SEAN KELSO  NEW YORK To the Editor: Having navigated this process as a parent and a professional application coach  I want to stress how critical it is to start early. Whether begun with excitement or dread  applying to college inevitably spins into overwhelming as deadlines near. After much touring and testing  September arrives and students find they’ve barely familiarized themselves with the ins and outs of the actual application. I recommend using the summer to make friends with the Common Application  and to start drafting the personal essay and assembling the extracurricular information requested. By the time September arrives  families will feel a better sense of control because they’ve left nothing to the last minute. So  for all those embarking on this journey  get a head start. It will mean a stronger application  anchored in a well-considered essay. It will also go a long way to preserving family harmony.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/28/opinion/sunday/college-debt-choices.html,Did I Choose the Wrong College? Advertisement Supported by None A novelist  professor and contributing opinion writer. I sometimes think I went to the wrong college. By many measures — most of them financial — my choice to attend Cornell was not the smartest one. I applied to only two colleges  the University of Florida and Cornell  because applying to college is an expensive process  and I didn’t know about fee waivers. What I did know was that thanks to my good grades and various state initiatives meant to entice students to stay in the state for college  I had an excellent financial aid package from the University of Florida: full tuition  room and board covered  the additional outside scholarships I’d earned going toward books and other expenses. I was about to be the first in my family to go to college  and it wouldn’t cost us a cent. Then  in April  I got into Cornell. I now know that the financial aid package was also strong  but it didn’t feel that way then: There was a subsidized loan of $4 000 a year in my name and an additional “expected family contribution.” If were I going to Cornell today  that contribution would have been zero  but this was before the school eliminated the parent contribution for families who made less than $60 000 a year. None My parents had listened carefully to everything the school had said about what this education could mean for me. We intuited that it would be an investment in a future that we’d be foolish to pass up. We didn’t know what  exactly  we were investing in  only that the result of this investment was whoever I was going to be. There was no way to know whether it would make a real difference in my life. But what the expensive school seemed to be promising was more options. My parents remortgaged their home to cover what Cornell calculated they could afford. Because I used to work as a college-access counselor for other first-generation college students  every year around this time I get anxious for families trying to do this same math. I called my mom in Miami recently to ask her why  in the end  they’d agreed to let me turn down a free ride. “Don’t you remember?” she said. She reminded me of a Cornell recruitment event in Coral Gables  an affluent area in South Florida  held at the large home of a successful and proud alum. “Me and your father couldn’t sleep that night  we were talking  thinking  O.K.  we’re two stupid people — not stupid  you know what I mean — and those people  they were just —” She trailed off  then added  “We wanted that for you  for you to have all that  be all that.” I asked her if she had found the event manipulative  and she said: “Of course it was! That’s how the world works!” I didn’t know that what we were deciding on was a kind of access and privilege that I didn’t yet understand. My parents  having worked trade jobs their whole lives  knew better. She asked me whether I thought I’d be where I am now if I’d made a different decision. I honestly don’t know. Where I am now is the Midwest  a newly tenured professor at a Big Ten school. My best friend from high school  who graduated second in our class and was supposed to be my Gator roommate  went to the University of Florida and loved it. She has a fulfilling career  rewarding friendships and a gorgeous house in a South Florida neighborhood we’d both always dreamed of living in: There is no “but” to alter these facts. At Cornell  I had a hallmate from Iowa whose family worked in pig ranching  the school she’d almost attended instead was the University of Iowa. She eventually chose to transfer back home. The way she put it  she realized she just didn’t need to be in upstate New York spending so much money for what she wanted to do with her future  though I’m sure there was more to it than that. The girls in my hall — myself included  all of us from the East Coast — teased her about her pig-ranching background  a fact of which I’m now very much ashamed. I don’t know why the University of Florida didn’t feel like the right place for me  but that feeling was strong enough to make me sign on for some major financial commitments at a school far from home at the ripe old age of 18 and head to a school that may not have been right for me either. I want to be clear here: I’m not trying to encourage people to take on debt. It would probably be even harder for me today to make the same decision I made in 1999  with the debt feeling even more insurmountable and new fears about what the job market would look like when I finished. But was it worth it? Did I need to go to the more expensive school? Here is my answer: When I started high school  my mother took me to an orthodontist. I had inherited my parents’ jacked-up teeth  and at the time when most of my friends were getting their braces removed  we were there potentially to start the whole ordeal  having waited until we were in a good enough financial position to do so. After poking around in my mouth and taking impressions of my teeth  the orthodontist declared that I did not need braces — my bite was mostly fine  so braces weren’t necessary and would be primarily for cosmetic reasons. Because we’d already identified ourselves as the kind of people who would need help affording orthodontics  the doctor thought this news would come as a relief to my mother. It did not: She started crying. “If she needed them  in my head that would make it easier to pay for it ” she said. “Everyone is getting braces. Someday they’ll all be people with straight teeth. I don’t want her to not have that.” She wanted to give me an advantage she never had  and this itself counted as a need — it had to. She knew that people might make assumptions about me based on something superficial. My braces came off my junior year of high school. I still sometimes wear my top retainer: I grind my teeth in my sleep  unconsciously undoing the work that made them straight. The bottom retainer no longer fits  thanks to a wisdom tooth I foolishly chose to leave in my head. It has all but pushed my bottom teeth back to where they started.

Trying to do just that  I teamed up to make this documentary film with the “reportage illustrator” George Butler  who has made it his work to depict some of the most important stories of our time through drawings. None We chose to focus on Tajikistan  which after a civil war is now one of the most remittance-dependent countries in the world. As young Tajiks grow up and seek to support themselves and their families in their economically depressed country  they typically encounter the same dilemma — to remain at home with dwindling work prospects or to head to Russia for possible work. By tapping into George’s style of reportage illustration  I wanted to portray an alternative  intimate style of documenting the difficult decisions faced by the youth there  to help us experience their plight in a different way. The themes of this story extend far beyond Tajikistan. Migration is happening in increasing numbers worldwide  and it involves far more stories than the disastrous ones we see on our front pages. We felt these equally powerful stories were represented well by Abdullo  a young Tajik who was on his fourth journey to Russia — traveling by rail from Dushanbe to Moscow on a 2 300-mile  four-day journey  undertaken because of the possibility of work. As Abdullo decides to leave once more  his best friend  Oyat  chooses to stay behind. _________ More?

Why? • What questions do you still have? None None None None When I first discovered the power of documentaries  one film that truly inspired me was “Unzipped ” a quintessential fashion documentary. To make this film  the director  Douglas Keeve  followed one of the era’s most successful high-fashion designers  Isaac Mizrahi  as he planned his fall 1994 collection. Mr. Keeve’s romantic connection to his subject seems to inform every gorgeous black-and-white frame of 16-millimeter film. This type of character-driven story can make for a riveting movie  and as a filmmaker I am captivated by figures who can draw my camera’s lens in a similarly magnetic way. The editor of Vogue  Anna Wintour  is one of those rare people. So when I had the opportunity to enter her world and follow her work with the Metropolitan Museum of Art  in New York  I embraced the challenge of capturing an icon of popular culture. But equally exciting was the prospect of unpacking many complex assumptions that go into our culture’s celebration of fashion  through a combination of vérité filmmaking and analytical argument. This Op-Doc goes behind the scenes at the Met and the celebrity-laden gala Ms. Wintour holds there each spring for its Costume Institute. In both this short and parts of my related feature “The First Monday in May ” I have tried to retreat from the fanfare — the layers of organizations  fans and consumers that make the fashion industry chug along — and ask why and how fashion occupies such a vaunted position in our culture and economy. I think the answer lies somewhere among the stunning works of painting and sculpture inside the Met. Here  works of fashion are interpreted in an art historical context that elevates what we are looking at beyond a consumer good or star vehicle. As I hope you see through the beautiful costumes in this film  ranging from antiquity to the red carpet frocks of Rihanna and Lady Gaga  fashion is certainly capable of serving as art — if you know where to look. _________ More?

That sight can leave an observer feeling disappointed  even insulted — it’s like watching a superhero clean his nails while you’re wishing he’d fly or pick up a car. Keep watching  though  and you begin to notice interesting things about the sleeping bear’s world: the hard  cold snow blown across ice or the sun turning into a vertical streak through sheets of sleet  the odd  sticky sensation of frost slowly growing over your beard. As a cinematographer  I’ve spent a lot of time observing the behaviors of the polar bears and humans who inhabit Churchill  Manitoba  a small town on the remote coast of Hudson’s Bay. I first arrived in Churchill as a teenager on my first gig and returned 25 years later  in 2015  to shoot a TV series on the bears of Churchill. When filming any wildlife  my first instinct is to create pristine images devoid of humanity. This is the ideal for nature films — a wild  charismatic animal free of the tethers and trappings of modernity. But these days  that ideal rarely matches reality — and it was nearly impossible to find in Churchill. Scattered among the polar bears on the outskirts of town are the ruins of Cold War projects  shipwrecks  plane wrecks and the abandoned material dreams of residents. Though I was initially frustrated  I began to shoot two versions of each shot — one a realistic portrayal of the bears’ habitat incorporating humanity and the other a cropped  pristine image suitable for prime time. Increasingly  I was drawn to the former: the juxtaposition of the bears  majestic symbols of the north  and the human artifacts and environments they haunted. As we shot over several months  contradictory emotions and ideas would present themselves. I loved being so close to the bears but worried that this contact might damage them. I hoped that the old  starving bear would survive  until I realized he had begun hunting a mother’s cub. I worried about the future of the bears but was struck that they might instead become the sole occupants of this depressed town I’d come to love. I wondered how accurate natural history films could really be and whether they were even capable of conveying the conflicts I was experiencing. None _________ More?

I met her through the Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival  an organization that encourages the revival of languages like Wukchumni. Through training and mentorship  it has supported Ms. Wilcox’s work for several years. Ms. Wilcox’s tribe  the Wukchumni  is not recognized by the federal government. It is part of the broader Yokuts tribal group native to Central California. Before European contact  as many as 50 000 Yokuts lived in the region  but those numbers have steadily diminished. Today  it is estimated that fewer than 200 Wukchumni remain. Like most Native Americans  the Wukchumni did not write their language until recently. Although several linguists documented the grammar of the Wukchumni language in the 20th century  Ms. Wilcox’s dictionary is the longest work of its kind. Ms. Wilcox has also recorded an oral version of the dictionary  including traditional Wukchumni stories like the “How We Got Our Hands” parable featured in the film. The pronunciation of the language  including intricate accents  will be preserved  which will assist future learners of the language. For Ms. Wilcox  the Wukchumni language has become her life. She spent more than seven years working on the dictionary and she continues to refine and update the text. Through her hard work and dedication  she has created a document that will support the revitalization of the Wukchumni language for decades to come. And Ms. Wilcox isn’t slowing down. Along with her daughter Jennifer Malone she travels to conferences throughout California and meets other tribes who also struggle with language loss. _________ More?

This film profiles Carlo Musso  a doctor who contemplates his moral compass as he participates in executions  though he personally opposes capital punishment. None Dr. Musso agrees that this may be the case  but is adamant that as long as the United States conducts executions  doctors should be involved. He argues that the involvement of doctors and their ability to ensure what he calls “end of life comfort measures” helps keep our capital punishment system as humane as possible. He is a pragmatist and a businessman  who has founded numerous companies  including CorrectHealth  a provider of correctional health care in Georgia. When I contacted him for this film  he was consumed by his newest venture: a nursing home that would care for geriatric parolees.

Gramps lived for 94 years — long enough to experience the Great Depression and the Great Recession  the birth of both television and virtual reality — and he chronicled the decades in a staggering collection of sketchbooks  each a literal chapter of his life. He shared the practice with his grandkids: he gave me my first sketchbook when I was 6  another when I was 8  and soon it was a yearly tradition. We’d often sketch along with him  I had never seen a nude model before he brought me along with him for a figure drawing session. I was 14. When Gramps died in 2015  it affected me deeply. I was 27 and working at Pixar Animation Studios  and I was just beginning to appreciate how much I owed my career in the arts to him. When I got an opportunity to take a storytelling workshop at the studio  I thought it a perfect excuse to make some sort of tribute to Gramps. But I didn’t really know where to start. After digging fruitlessly for the right story  I decided to call my dad — recording without his knowledge — to see what might come of a conversation. And I lucked out: There was a sketchbook he had recently scanned that he wanted to send me. When I opened Gramps’s “memory book” for the first time  albeit digitally  it was a dizzying experience. I had seen many of his earlier sketchbooks  including the ones he kept during World War II  keenly observed and cleverly captioned  they’re an evocative and playful account of his war experience. There were also travelogues  and sketchbooks just for dreams that were filled with the vivid images that his subconscious cooked up nightly. But the memory book was different. It was like all his sketchbooks compressed into one — an impressionistic retrospective stretching back to early childhood. There were stories of long-lost friends next to struggles at work  moments of historical significance flowing into prosaic family vignettes: kaleidoscopic portals into moments of my grandfather’s life. Dad and I ended up flipping through the pages for over an hour  and story after story rushed out. _________ More? None None • Film Club will resume on Thursday  April 12  after a short spring break.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/10/learning/lesson-plans/nine-teaching-ideas-for-using-music-to-inspire-student-writing.html,Nine Teaching Ideas for Using Music to Inspire Student Writing Advertisement Supported by None None In this teaching resource  we suggest nine exercises to use music to inspire student writing — from creating annotated playlists and critical reviews to music-inspired poetry and personal narratives. Each idea pulls from Times reporting  Opinion pieces and multimedia on music to give students a place to start. The activities are categorized according to three genres: creative and narrative writing  informative and explanatory writing  and persuasive and argumentative writing. How do you use music in your classroom? Let us know in the comments. _________ Exercise #1: Write a story or poem inspired by music. One way you might let your students be inspired by music is to have them describe in words what they hear  a method Jean-Michel Basquiat employed in his poetry and paintings. None In 1979  at 19  the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat moved into an abandoned apartment on East 12th Street in Manhattan with his girlfriend at the time  Alexis Adler. The home  a sixth-floor walk-up  was run-down and sparsely furnished. Basquiat  broke and unable to afford canvases  painted with abandon on the walls and floor  even on Ms. Adler’s clothes. The one item that remained undisturbed was Ms. Adler’s stereo  which had pride of place on a shelf scavenged from the street. “The main thing for us was having big speakers and a blasting stereo. That was the only furniture I purchased myself ” said Ms. Adler  who still lives in the apartment. When Basquiat was around  she recalled  “music was playing all the time.” On Thursday  the exhibition “Basquiat: Boom for Real” opened at the Barbican Center in London. The show focuses on the artist’s relationship to music  text  film and television. But it is jazz — the musical style that made up the bulk of Basquiat’s huge record collection — that looms largest as a source of personal inspiration to him and as a subject matter. None None None None From the stillness around you a high glassy sound descends  like first light. Each new sound seems to breathe — emerging from and receding back into the stillness — and the glint of bells  like desert plants  here and there. Almost imperceptibly the music swells and continues falling in pitch. From somewhere above — like a gleam of metal  like sunlight emerging from behind a ridgeline — comes the sound of flutes. You are in a strange landscape. You don’t know how to read the weather or the light. You are unsure how long you will be here  or how challenging the journey may be. To take this exercise a step further  students might use what they wrote while listening to music to develop a short story or poem. They might share their writing and song choices with the class so their classmates can analyze how music inspired their writing. Exercise #2: Pen your own song or rap. None None None None None Exercise #3: Share what music means to you. What role does music play in your students’ lives? None None None _________ None Music has always been a reflection of and window into society  culture and history — and the current era is no different. Hip-hop  folk  classical and even opera music draw on current events and politics for source material. What connections can your students make between the music they listen to and current events? How does learning more about the context in which a song was written help them better understand it? None But Glover’s graceful moves aren’t exactly the point. There’s plenty of messaging about race  violence and the entertainment industry in the song and video — which helps explain why fans and critics have devoted so much time to dissecting its references and debating its meaning. None The video has already been rapturously described as a powerful rally cry against gun violence  a powerful portrait of black-American existentialism  a powerful indictment of a culture that circulates videos of black children dying as easily as it does videos of black children dancing in parking lots. You might have students read the roundup or one of the articles it excerpts  or let them choose another topic or genre that interests them  such as: None For whichever article they choose  students should consider: What current events does the music they read about reference? How do these allusions contribute to the artist’s message? What other themes in the music can they relate to what is happening in the world? Then  challenge students to pair a song of their choosing with one or more Times articles and write an essay that explains the relationship between the song and the current or historical events. None None Exercise #5: Create an annotated playlist of songs related to a topic. None None None None None First Aid Kit  a duo of sisters from Sweden who usually favor a folky  countryish approach — they’ve got a song named “Emmylou ” after Ms. Harris — turn to a gauzy retro sound in “Fireworks ” a song always about ending up lonely: “Why do I do this to myself every time/I know the way it ends even before it’s begun.” With a 1950s slow-dance beat and echoey guitars  it’s already nostalgic for the next failed romance. J.P. Ask students: What do they notice about h ow the commentary is written? What does the writer include and why? How is it organized? What makes it interesting (or not)? After students have curated their own playlists  they are ready to write song annotations. Some ingredients they should include in their writing are: a claim explaining how the song relates to the topic or theme  evidence from the song (e.g.  lyrics  instruments  rhythm or melodies) illustrating their claim  and analysis that explains the significance of these aspects of the song. None Exercise #6: Profile an artist in an imagined interview. The Times Music section regularly profiles artists from different genres  time periods and corners of the globe. Students can use these articles and interviews as mentor texts before doing research and writing their own mini-biographies of a music figure they admire. In an “imagined interview ” students  working individually or in pairs  play the part of both interviewer and interviewee. They do background research on an artist they select  come up with a list of questions and answers for the interview  and then write a profile on their subject. To start  have students read one of these interviews with musicians: None Ask students: What types of questions did the interviewer ask? What subjects did the two discuss? What questions were missing from the interview that you wish were asked? If you plan on having students write narratives based on their imagined interviews  they should also read at least one example of how Times writers write narratives based on interviews. Here are a few: None While reading  they should consider the following: What information did the reporter include and why do you think they made these choices? How did they effectively weave in biographical details to tell a story about the artist and the music? Next  assign students to choose their own musical artist to interview and profile. The following steps can guide students through the process: None None None None None _________ Exercise #7: Review an artist  album or song. None You might allow students to choose one of their favorite (or least favorite) artists or songs to practice writing passionately and knowledgeably about a subject. Or  challenge them to explore a genre of music they might not normally listen to and see what they can learn. None Exercise #8: Weigh in on the latest criticisms  trends and news in music. None You can invite students to weigh in on the music-related topics they care about most in a group writing activity that mimics the conversational style of this podcast. Here  they learn how to make a claim  develop it with evidence  write counterclaims and respond directly to one another in an informal and fun way. None None None None None None None None Exercise #9: Write an editorial on a music-related topic. Many musicians and music aficionados also contribute Opinion pieces to The Times  where they write passionately and persuasively about music’s influence in their lives  culture and society. What music-related topics do your students care about? Do they believe music should be a required subject in school? What do they think today’s artists say about the world they live in? Can and should musicians’ work be separated from their personal lives? None You can pair any one of these lessons with music editorials as mentor texts  like the ones below: None None None _________ Lesson Plan | The Ten-Dollar Founding Father Without a Father: Teaching and Learning With ‘Hamilton’ Lesson Plan | Teaching With Protest Music Teaching Close Reading and Compelling Writing With the ‘New Sentences’ Column Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,students and education

None None None None I started making documentaries by shooting fragments of my family’s life on their farm  in the snow-covered mountains of Jura  in eastern France. My fascination with documenting rural  snow-covered and remote worlds on film is what led me to Greenland. I first visited Greenland in 2015. That was when I met Julius  a villager who guided me through the five villages around Tasiilaq  which with around 2 000 inhabitants is the largest town on Greenland’s east coast. It quickly became obvious I would focus my film on Julius’s own village  Tiniteqilaaq. The village has only around 60 inhabitants and is isolated from the rest of the world by ice for about nine months every year. Over the course of the next year  I spent several months there and learned to share the lifestyle of its inhabitants: I went hunting and fishing with the men  shared family dinners of seal and narwhal  and attended baptisms and funerals. Little by little  I was accepted by Julius’s friends and family. After all  we shared more in common than it might have seemed: Since I come from a village of 250 in Jura  there is nothing less exotic to me than a village half that size. None The result is a portrait of Asser Boassen  an 8-year-old Tunumiit boy who wants to become a hunter. Like many children of his village  Asser has not been raised by his biological parents. Instead  he lives with his grandparents  Thomasine and Gert Jonathansen. In many ways  Asser’s daily life as a young boy  fed by the hunting tradition passed on by his grandfather and by the mythical stories told by his grandmother  represents challenges many in modern Greenland are navigating. When Asser turns 12  he will have to leave his village to attend middle school in the city  far away. When he returns to his village  he will be 16  effectively an adult  and uprooted from the traditions and knowledge he spent his childhood absorbing from his grandparents. Across the country  Inuit children are torn between two conceptions of education  one rooted in their native identity and the other imposed by a globalized world — knowledge that is essential for navigating that very world. The outcomes are often problematic. But for now Asser is just a child dreaming to become a great hunter. As great as Qajaarngaa  the mythical hunter who triumphs in Asser’s grandmother’s tale. _________ More? None None • Our next Film Club will take place on Friday  March 16.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/07/opinion/sunday/chimps-legal-personhood.html,Should Chimpanzees Be Considered ‘Persons’? Advertisement Supported by The Stone None Mr. Sebo is the director of the animal studies program at New York University. You might be aware that chimpanzees can recognize themselves in a mirror  communicate through sign language  pursue goals creatively and form long-lasting friendships. You might also think that these are the kinds of things that a person can do. However  you might not think of chimpanzees as persons. The Nonhuman Rights Project does. Since 2013  the group has been working on behalf of two chimpanzees  Kiko and Tommy  currently being held in cages by their “owners” without the company of other chimpanzees. It is asking the courts to rule that Kiko and Tommy have the right to bodily liberty and to order their immediate release into a sanctuary where they can live out the rest of their lives with other chimpanzees. The problem is that under current United States law  one is either a “person” or a “thing.” There is no third option. If you are a person  you have the capacity for rights  including the right to habeas corpus relief  which protects you from unlawful confinement. If you are a thing  you do not have the capacity for rights. And unfortunately  even though they are sensitive  intelligent  social beings  Kiko and Tommy are considered things under the law. In response  the Nonhuman Rights Project is taking a bold position: It is arguing that if every being must be either a person or a thing  then Kiko and Tommy are persons  not things. I agree  and many other philosophers do  too. None The idea of nonhuman personhood might seem confusing at first  since we tend to use the terms “human” and “person” interchangeably. But they are not equivalent. “Human” is best understood as a biological concept that refers  at present  to a member of a particular species  Homo sapiens. In contrast  “person” is best understood as a moral and legal concept that refers to an individual who can hold moral and legal rights. The question  then  is: If “human” and “person” are not interchangeable  why might someone think that only humans can be persons? One view is that only humans can be persons because humanity is the basis of personhood. However  this view is implausible. There is nothing special about species in and of themselves. They are morally arbitrary taxonomic categories. There is a great deal of variability within species  similarity among species and change in species over time. When we think about the basis of our own personhood  we do not think about how we happen to be classified in a biology textbook. Instead  we think about features of our lives such as conscious experience  emotionality  a sense of self and bonds of care and interdependence. When it comes to whether one should be treated as a person or a thing  these kinds of features  and not their genetic bases or evolutionary histories  are what matter. This is why we can all know that we have rights without having to check our genes. Another view is that only humans can be persons because only humans have the ability to use language and reason in abstract and sophisticated ways. Kiko and Tommy can do many impressive things  including communicate with others and pursue goals in a creative  intelligent manner. But they cannot do these things in the same kinds of ways that many humans can. None But now suppose we accept a more inclusive view of personhood  according to which humans are persons because we have some or all of the features mentioned before: conscious experience  emotionality  a sense of self or bonds of care or interdependence. This view is more plausible than the opposing view  in part because it includes all humans within the scope of personhood. At the same time  it includes some nonhumans too. For example  Kiko and Tommy are conscious  emotional  intelligent  social beings whose lives are deeply entangled with our own  their current state of isolation notwithstanding. As a result  they count as persons on any view inclusive enough to meet contemporary standards of human rights. The idea of nonhuman personhood does raise difficult questions. One question is which rights nonhumans can have. For instance  if Kiko and Tommy can have the right to liberty  can they also have the right to property? What about the right to free expression or association  or the right to political representation or participation? Another question is which nonhumans can have rights. For instance  if Kiko and Tommy can have rights  can bonobos and gorillas have rights too? What about cats  dogs and fish? What about chickens  cows and pigs? What about ants or sophisticated artificial intelligence programs? These questions are unsettling. They are also reasonable to ask. After all  we might think that we need to draw the line somewhere. So if we decide not to draw the line at species membership — if we decide to accept that at least some nonhumans can have at least some rights — then it is not immediately clear where to draw it instead  or even  on reflection  whether to draw this particular kind of line at all. However  it is important to keep two points in mind. First  the fact that a question is unsettling is not a justification for avoiding it. We should not ignore injustice out of fear of what it might mean to recognize it. Second  the fact that a question is reasonable is not a justification for doubling down on our current answer. Some lines need to be either redrawn or eliminated. The history of human rights struggles (to say nothing of contemporary human rights struggles) is evidence enough of that. Sometimes when we are overwhelmed by the complexity of an issue  it can help to start by stating a simple truth and going from there. In this case  the simple truth is that Kiko and Tommy are not mere things. Whatever else we say about the nature and limits of moral and legal personhood  we should be willing to say at least that. The only alternative is to continue to accept an arbitrary and exclusionary view about what it takes to merit moral and legal recognition. Kiko and Tommy deserve better than that  and so do the rest of us. None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,students and education

Advertisement Supported by None SAN ANTONIO — With all the catcalls  cheers and interruptions  it took awhile for the roll call to proceed at the three loudest tables on a bustling restaurant patio along the Riverwalk here Thursday night. But one by one  the 30 attendees stood and announced their name  hometown and class at Maguire University. Some wore T-shirts with the Maguire logo  others had pins or branded pullovers. They ranged in age from 25 to 81. There was a freshman  a junior and even several members of Maguire’s hall of fame. Then the next round of beers arrived. “There are no rules at a fake university ” Meg Comer said. Rules have never gotten in the way of a good time for this raucous group of basketball fans who have been attending the Final Four since the 1960s as members of a club — or  ahem  a “university” — called Maguire  named after a bar in Chicago  where its founders made it out of whole cloth. None Loyola won the national championship that first year. Now the Ramblers (32-5) are back and  55 years later  the legacy of the Maguire University hoax lives on. While the original perpetrators were eventually discovered by the N.C.A.A.  which gives away tickets only to legitimate schools  a club was formed to keep the Final Four trips alive. The members maintained the university theme — Maguire has a chancellor  an admissions director  a dean of its nonexistent law school and a coach of its nonexistent swim team — and enrollment has swelled to more than 1 000  at least according to the email list. Four trips to the Final Four with Maguire are considered enough to graduate  with a degree in bracketology and a minor in intoxicology. But there were plenty of alumni eager to visit San Antonio for this year’s 56th meeting  Comer reserved a block of 60 rooms at the Drury Plaza Hotel almost two years ago. Some were Loyola-Chicago fans  others were rooting for Villanova. Still more were here for other  more social reasons. “It’s like getting thrown into the deep end of a pool ” Rudy Fasciani of Croton-on-Hudson  N.Y.  who described himself as a fifth-year senior  said  “that’s full of beer.” Though they call themselves the Jollymen  Maguire officials and graduates finally ceded to Title IX in 2003 and began accepting women  like Comer  who serves as treasurer. There are no dues  but there is tuition  which goes toward financing the annual Final Four pilgrimage  which this year ran around $2 000 for a five-night hotel stay. That does not include airfare  or the lengthy bar tabs  or even a ticket to the games. In fact  most of the attendees won’t step foot inside the Alamodome. “We’ll watch the game ” John Kurek  81  said as he nursed a glass of wine. “But it will be from the bar.” Kurek  a member of the Maguire hall of fame (he has the emerald cubic zirconia ring to prove it) making his 25th straight Final Four trip  was sitting next to Charlie Hounihan  a Loyola graduate who remembers watching the 1963 team in action. They both live in Chicago and frequently attend Kelly’s Pub  which replaced Maguire’s as the main campus in 1988. Pointing to the far table  full of New Yorkers  Hounihan said  “That’s the East Coast campus.” Indeed  few of the attendees had any connection to Maguire’s  or to Loyola  or even to Chicago. The club’s founder  Len Tyrrell  died in 2015  and none of the other original pranksters were able to make it to San Antonio this year. But their ranks keep growing. Al Naclerio  67  of White Plains  said he enrolled six years ago  in New Orleans  when he stumbled upon a Maguire party at a hospitality suite one night. “It was like  Why am I knocking my head against the wall trying to get a hotel room?” Naclerio said. “These people are great people  they find a great place and they’re fun to be with.” It seems there is no end to the recruiting. At the restaurant on Thursday  by the time the chipotle chicken and spicy shrimp arrived  even the waiter was wearing a Maguire University pin. The school does have a smattering of other organized events throughout the year  such as a burger cooking competition to raise money for Operation Support Our Troops. And when the New York Athletic Club honors a college basketball coach with the annual Winged Foot Award  Art Duffy  the current Maguire chancellor  presents that coach with an honorary Maguire University graduation certificate behind the scenes. “Coach K has graduated twice ” Duffy said  referring to Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski. “He’s got his undergrad and his master’s.” But the welcome dinner  Comer said  is “probably the one time we’re going to sit down and have a civilized meal — other than pub food.” A freshman  Betty Sharples  43  chimed in  “Civilized is the opposite phrase.” At around 8:25 p.m.  Duffy stood for a toast. “This is a little more special than most ” Duffy said  adding that the Maguire story had “come full circle.” As in 1963  few expected Loyola-Chicago to compete for a national title. This year  the Ramblers became only the fourth team seeded No. 11 to reach the Final Four  so it seemed the team was the sentimental favorite. But Chicago is only a part of the connection now. Comer  46  said there was something else besides camaraderie and alcohol that kept the 100 or so people who attend every year coming back. “We all love basketball ” she said. “We enjoy the games. We love the Final Four. If you bring people together that all love the same thing  it’s pretty easy to build momentum.” None None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,students and education
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/13/world/asia/japan-african-university-president-sacko.html,In Homogeneous Japan  an African-Born University President Advertisement Supported by The Saturday Profile None KYOTO  Japan — On a beautiful spring Sunday during cherry blossom season  the new president of Kyoto Seika University welcomed students for the start of the Japanese school year. “You have left your home ” he told the 770 first-year and graduate students gathered in a gym on the hilly campus. “But this is also your home.” In Bamanankan — the lingua franca of his native Mali. And so Oussouby Sacko  51  quickly dispensed with the elephant in the room: He is a black man in a homogeneous country that has long had an ambivalent relationship with outsiders. Dr. Sacko  who is believed to be the first African-born president of a Japanese university  segued elegantly into fluent Japanese  invoking Hannah Arendt  Edward Said  Eleanor Roosevelt and the Malian writer Amadou Hampâté Bâ. The university  Dr. Sacko said  was “diversifying and internationalizing ” and he wanted the students to “recognize your difference from others.” In this island country that is sometimes less than welcoming to immigrants  Mr. Sacko is an outlier. A resident for 27 years  he obtained Japanese citizenship 16 years ago and worked his way up through the ranks of a Japanese institution. None None Obtaining Japanese citizenship is extremely difficult. Since 1952  just over 550 000 people have managed to naturalize as Japanese citizens  most of them ethnic Koreans whose families have lived in Japan for several generations since the colonial occupation of Korea. None Dr. Sacko says he believes Japan needs to allow in more outsiders  simply as an act of self-preservation. “Japanese people think they have to protect something ” he said during an interview in English before a reception recently to celebrate his appointment. But  “someone who has a broad view from outside on your culture can maybe help you objectively improve your goals ” he said  occasionally interrupting the interview to greet his guests  switching effortlessly between English  French and Japanese. Dr. Sacko  the eldest son of a customs officer and homemaker  grew up in Bamako  the capital city of Mali. A strong student  he won a scholarship from the Malian government to attend college abroad. He had never been anywhere other than the neighboring country of Senegal. With 13 other students from Mali  he was assigned to study in China and landed in Beijing in 1985 to study Mandarin before embarking on a degree in engineering and architecture at Southeast University in Nanjing. On a vacation to Japan after obtaining his undergraduate degree in 1990  Dr. Sacko found himself enchanted by what he observed as strong community ties and the hospitality toward guests. Although he had begun graduate studies in China  he was frustrated that a government minder always shadowed him when he conducted field research in local villages. He had also met and started to date a Japanese woman  Chikako Tanaka  whom he later married and with whom he has two sons. Dr. Sacko moved to Osaka  Japan  for six months of language lessons before enrolling in a master’s degree program at Kyoto University. In meetings with colleagues  he was often asked to take minutes  which helped him improve his listening comprehension and writing ability. At night  he watched Japanese television shows and socialized with Japanese classmates. His dedication to becoming fluent distinguished him from other foreigners. “They said  ‘If you speak Japanese  they will put you in meetings and on committees and that’s not interesting ’ ” he said. Many foreigners  he added  “spend too much time among ourselves.” Dr. Sacko said he had hoped to return to Mali someday  but after a military coup in 1991  his employment options were limited. As he pursued a doctorate in Japan  he worked to understand a culture where people can say the exact opposite of what they mean. “You don’t always catch things from the meanings of the words ” he said. “You have to go deeper.” Along the way  there were some misunderstandings. After hosting a few parties at his apartment  his neighbors remarked that he and his friends always seemed happy and that they were envious. Dr. Sacko urged them to join his next party. Instead  they called the police. “The police said  ‘You are too noisy ’ ” Dr. Sacko recalled. “And I said ‘But my neighbors like that!’ ” He applied for a job at Kyoto Seika  which specializes in the arts  and started as a lecturer in 2001. Colleagues say that over the years he has worked very hard to adapt to Japanese social codes while also retaining his own sensibility. “He deeply understands Japanese culture and the way of thinking ” said Emiko Yoshioka  a professor of art theory whom Dr. Sacko appointed as vice president at Kyoto Seika. “But he also is able to poke fun at the fact that he is a foreigner.” The faculty vote for president was extremely close  with Dr. Sacko winning by just one vote. At his inaugural reception  a group of musicians played Malian music on a patio  and Dr. Sacko stood quietly on a small stage during a parade of speeches from the mayor of Kyoto  the Malian ambassador to Japan  and various academic colleagues  including a professor from Kyoto University who repeatedly slipped up and called him “Professor Mali.” Ryo Ishida  chairman of Kyoto Seika’s board  noted that the university had recently started a campaign to embrace diversity. “But I don’t think his election was much to do with the university’s promotion of diversity ” Mr. Ishida said. “He was elected as the best leader of the university among his colleagues.” In a practical sense  Dr. Sacko’s appointment could help Kyoto Seika appeal to more foreign students at a time when many universities across Japan are struggling to maintain enrollment. Already  20 percent of its student body comes from abroad  much higher than the 4 percent overall ratio of foreign students in Japanese higher education. Dr. Sacko said he hoped to raise Kyoto Seika’s level to 40 percent within a decade. “I think he will help shrink the distance between Japanese and foreigners ” said Chihiro Morita  18  an illustration major from Hyogo Prefecture. None None Dr. Sacko said he had not experienced racism in Japan but said he was treated differently simply because he does not look Japanese. Despite his Japanese citizenship  for example  he says he is automatically routed to lines for foreigners at the airport when he returns from trips abroad. “It’s not because you’re black ” he said. “It’s because you’re different.” He said he considered it his mission to foster differences beyond race. When recruiting Ms. Yoshioka as vice president  he told her he wanted her for the job because she was a woman and a single mother. “If we don’t have a person like you in the top administration of the university  the board will just be filled with men ” he told her when she first hesitated to take the job. “And that doesn’t fit my vision.” None Makiko Inoue contributed reporting None None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,students and education
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/12/opinion/back-to-school-at-64.html,Back to School  at 64 Advertisement Supported by On Campus None “Will I be the oldest person here?” I asked the chairman of the nonfiction writing program at Columbia University  shortly after I was accepted. He laughed and said no. There were two or three older  but not by much. “It takes a lifetime to make a writer ” he continued. And I’ve had the lifetime. I was 64 when I entered graduate school. I had just left the work force — not retired  just tired. Tired of hitting the glass ceiling and of policies that failed to protect employees from abuse. As disenchantment with my job grew  writing became a healthy distraction. I applied to Columbia with no expectation of acceptance and no idea how to pay for it. My husband and I had just finished paying for our kids’ education and we didn’t have enough for retirement. But then one snowy February evening  the head of the writing program called as I stirred a pot of soup  and said  “You’re in  and there will be a scholarship.” I dropped my wooden spoon. Sure  I’d written copy at ad agencies for 20 years  started a memoir and taken some online classes. But did that make me a writer? And the Ivy League part scared me. I imagined I wasn’t smart enough. But I also realized I had some things to say. I sat in workshops and seminars during my first semester at Columbia  ashamed of my age and surrounded by brilliant young people. They were polite  but I assumed my work held little interest for them. I don’t swipe for sex. I haven’t pulled an all-nighter in decades. I thought they’d laugh at my flapping upper arms and my wrinkly neck  even though many of them admire Nora Ephron. Some of my instructors were close in age to me  winners of Pulitzers with decades of writing and publishing experience. Some were just a little older than my children. I wondered  was it too late for me to do this? My peers wrote about online dating  strange roommates  odd living situations  first big loves and rejections. Others wrote memoirs about life with a meth-addicted father or what it means to be biracial. We all struggled to be emotionally honest on the page. For me  that meant finding restraint and perspective by stepping back  seeing my own complicity in much of what’s happened in my life. My classmates transported me back to my own 20s and 30s. I attended the University of California  Berkeley  during the second wave of feminism. In the 1970s  solidarity with the antiwar movement meant cooking for the male demonstrators. Now things are different. Gender identification is not assumed. Respect for difference is. I’ve been asked not only for my name but also for my preferred pronouns. Inevitably  I blundered. One icy January morning I dug out the warmest coat I owned. On my way into class  shivering vegans jeered at me. What was I thinking? My kids are vegan. The coat  trimmed in rabbit fur at the neckline  now hangs at the back of my closet where my cat occasionally tries to kill it or have sex with it. After several workshops in which everyone felt overexposed  I realized no one cared how old I was. Workshops are like the painting critiques I endured as an undergraduate in the art department at Berkeley. But they’re different now — criticism no longer terrifies me. My defensiveness has been worn away. I’m better able to hear the helpful parts and understand what I would have taken personally years ago. I’m finally a good student. And I don’t have to worry that what I write will make things awkward with my parents at Christmas. I have fewer distractions than my younger classmates. Dating and the insecurity that went with it are memories. Figuring out my sexuality and experimenting with illegal substances no longer consume my weekends. One professor said  “You have to write badly before you can write well.” Along with my fear of being too old  my first semester held plenty of writing badly. But I kept going  figuring they’d admitted me and provided a scholarship for a reason. Now I’m in my final semester. I’m amazed by my talented peers and by their easygoing acceptance and candor. Despite the age difference  we’ve fed one another in many ways — emotionally  intellectually and literally (I’ve brought tomatoes from my garden  while another student brought freshly baked bread). Although my professors have been stellar  much of my education has come from reading and listening to my fellow students — on a grandmother in India  an Armenian family’s path  post-genocide  sorority life in 2017  and what it means to be transgender within an authoritarian regime. I’ve been warned by my professors that a degree in writing is unlikely to bring riches. That’s okay. I’ve been enriched beyond measure. And like my peers  I’ve got some stories to tell. A lifetime of them. None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,students and education
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/17/magazine/how-liberty-university-built-a-billion-dollar-empire-online.html,How Liberty University Built a Billion-Dollar Empire Online With a hard sell to prospective students and huge amounts in taxpayer funding  Jerry Falwell Jr. transformed the evangelical institution into a behemoth. None This article is a collaboration between The Times and ProPublica  the independent nonprofit investigative-journalism organization. None Penny Nance  a newly named Liberty trustee who is the head of the socially conservative group Concerned Women for America  took the stage to say that with Donald Trump in the White House  the country was much closer to overturning Roe v. Wade and putting “true limits on the abortionist’s hand.” Tim Lee  a Texas preacher and evangelist who lost his legs in the Vietnam War  gave a sermon bemoaning “homosexuals and pornographers ” declaring that one problem with “pulpits today is that they’ve got a lot of girlie men in them.” A young man in front of me in a Nautica T-shirt clapped and shouted  “That’s right!” None Advertisement Jerry Falwell Jr.  who has led the university since 2007  lacks the charisma and high profile of his father  who helped lead the rise of the religious right within the Republican Party. Yet what the soft-spoken Falwell  55  lacks in personal aura  he has more than made up for in institutional ambition. As Liberty has expanded over the past two decades  it has become a powerful force in the conservative movement. The Liberty campus is now a requisite stop for Republican candidates for president — with George W. Bush  John McCain and Mitt Romney all making the pilgrimage — and many of Liberty graduates end up working in Republican congressional offices and conservative think tanks. Liberty has also played a significant role in the rise of Donald Trump. Falwell was an early supporter of the reality-TV-star candidate  staying loyal through the release of the “Access Hollywood” tape and giving Trump a crucial imprimatur with white evangelical voters  who widely supported him at the polls. “The evangelicals were so great to me ” Trump said in an interview last year. The first commencement speech he gave as president  last spring  was at Liberty. And in August  Falwell stood by Trump following his much-criticized remarks on the violent rally by white supremacists in Charlottesville  declaring on “Fox & Friends” that “President Donald Trump does not have a racist bone in his body.” Such steadfast allyship has prompted ridicule even from some fellow evangelical Republicans. But it makes more sense in light of an overlooked aspect of Liberty: its extraordinary success as a moneymaking venture. Like Trump  Falwell recognized the money to be made in selling success — in this case  through the booming and lightly regulated realm of online higher education. Falwell’s university has achieved the scale and stature it has because he identified a market opportunity and exploited it. Advertisement None By 2017  Liberty students were receiving more than $772 million in total aid from the U.S. Department of Education — nearly $100 million of it in the form of Pell grants and the rest in federal student loans. Among universities nationwide  it ranked sixth in federal aid. Liberty students also received Department of Veterans Affairs benefits  some $42 million in 2016  the most recent year for which figures are available. Although some of that money went to textbooks and nontuition expenses  a vast majority of Liberty’s total revenue that year  which was just above $1 billion  came from taxpayer-funded sources. And it was no secret which part of the university was generating most of that revenue  said Chris Gaumer  a Liberty graduate and former professor of English there. “When I was there  at faculty meetings the commentary was that online was funding the school  while they were trying to just break even on the residential side ” he said. “It was understood that on the online side  they were making a killing.” None He founded Thomas Road Baptist Church in the former offices of a bottling company in 1956 and soon began broadcasting recordings of his sermons on regional radio and television. In 1971  the same year his “Old Time Gospel Hour” went national  he founded Lynchburg Baptist College  subsidizing it with revenues from the show. “I believe there are thousands of young students who will catch the vision and who will carry what God is doing in Lynchburg to cities all over the continent and around the world ” he declared at the time  according to his 1996 autobiography. At first the college was scattered in rented spaces around town — a vacant high school  a Ramada Inn — but by 1977 it had been renamed Liberty Baptist College and moved up to an initial 2 000-acre swath of land on the mountain. By 1984  nearly 400 local broadcasters around the nation were carrying “The Old Time Gospel Hour.” The toll-free number flashing on the screen reportedly helped bring in more than $72 million per year in donations. Some $10 million of those funds flowed to the college  which at that point numbered about 4 500 students. Another of Falwell’s enterprises pulled in about $12 million a year — the Moral Majority  an attempt to build a cross-denominational political coalition against the common foes of abortion rights and  as he later put it  “moral permissiveness  family breakdown and general capitulation to evil and to foreign policies such as Marxism-Leninism.” None But another element of the business model — evangelical broadcasting’s aura of rectitude — was about to take a hit. That March  Jim Bakker resigned as head of the televangelist PTL ministry amid revelations of a sexual encounter with a former church secretary  Jessica Hahn  who received a payoff to keep quiet about it  Bakker later served just under five years in prison on a federal fraud conviction related to PTL’s fund-raising. In 1988  the televangelist Jimmy Swaggart declared  “I have sinned ” following reports of his consorting with a prostitute in New Orleans  three years later  the police pulled him over with another prostitute in Southern California. Advertisement No such scandals attached to Falwell  who succeeded Bakker as host of “The PTL Club.” But the bubble had burst. Amid what Falwell later referred to as the “credibility crunch” caused by the televangelist scandals  the college’s finances deteriorated. Within a few years  annual contributions dropped by $25 million  the college’s debt swelled to more than $100 million. In 1996  the accrediting body overseeing Liberty presented a list of more than 100 “recommendations” for staying accredited  including a demand that it reduce its debt. Falwell went on a 40-day liquids-only fast  praying for deliverance. “I am certain that we will become a world-class university training champions for Christ in every important field of study ” Falwell vowed in his autobiography. “And I am asking God to give me more time to guide and fund that dream.” One educational novelty that Falwell dabbled in  starting in the mid-’70s  was an early form of distance learning. Liberty would mail lecture videotapes and course packets to paying customers around the country — at first just certificate courses in Bible studies  and by the mid-’80s  accredited courses in other subjects as well. By the time of Liberty’s financial embattlement  other education innovators had taken the idea much further — none more so than a man named John Sperling. Sperling was an unlikely capitalist entrepreneur. The son of a failed farmer in the Missouri Ozarks  he joined the Merchant Marine  embraced socialism and ended up receiving a Ph.D. in history from the University of Cambridge. He got a job teaching at San Jose State University  where he took over the faculty union and led a big strike in 1968. His humble origins and early socialist leanings had given him a jaundiced view of elite schools  and his experience teaching a course to police officers and teachers as part of a federally funded effort to reduce juvenile delinquency furthered his belief that traditional colleges were leaving out a whole swath of Americans eager for higher education. He decided to start a university of his own — not a nonprofit but a for-profit  and not in California  where he had clashed with skeptical accreditors  but in the laxer regulatory climate of Arizona. In 1976  Sperling rented space in a boilermakers’ union hall in Phoenix and started offering weekly classes there to eight students — all adults who’d had some college education and were looking to complete their degrees. A decade later  University of Phoenix had 6 000 students. But things really took off three years later  in 1989  when Sperling started offering M.B.A.s online through Prodigy  the early electronic communications service. Sperling took the university’s parent company public in 1994  by 2000  enrollment had reached 100 000. By the early 2000s  for-profit colleges were booming: Access to the internet was spreading  and the Bush administration was employing a notably light regulatory touch  even as the programs were devouring an ever-greater share of federal student aid. Among the adopters of Sperling’s model was Falwell  who in 2004 began expanding the family’s primitive distance-learning programs into what would become known as Liberty University Online. In his autobiography  Falwell praised Jerry Jr.’s business instincts  crediting him with saving Liberty from ruin through his management of its debt. “God sent him to me just in time ” he wrote. “He is more responsible  humanly speaking  for the miraculous financial survival of this ministry than any other single person.” When Falwell died in 2007 at age 73  his younger son  Jonathan  took over the pulpit at Thomas Road Baptist  and Jerry Jr. took over the university — an indication of where the heart of the ministry now was. As the Great Recession hit  laid-off Americans turned to online education to seek a new economic foothold. After years of trying to save Liberty by cutting costs  Falwell Jr. said  he adopted his father’s vision of saving it through increasing revenues. In a recent telephone interview  Falwell described the surge in online enrollment as a kind of revelation. “It took us about 20 years to perfect” the distance-learning model  he said  “but when we did  that was about when everyone started getting high-speed internet in their homes  and we were the only nonprofit poised to serve that huge adult market of people who had not finished college or needed a master’s degree to get a promotion.” Advertisement Liberty had another advantage over online competitors  he said: its status as a religious-based institution  “that long history of Liberty being a leader among Christian universities ” the “faith-based mission” that “makes us so unique and puts us in a class by ourselves.” None At the front lines are the “admissions representatives ” some 300 phone recruiters working two shifts from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.  deploying call lists that Liberty gets from websites where people register and search for information about online higher education  like BestCollegesOnline.com. There is such a race to get to customers before University of Phoenix and other rivals that the prospective students sometimes marvel at how little time has elapsed — just a handful of minutes — between their providing their information on a website and the call coming from Liberty. Liberty’s tax filings show that in 2016  the university paid Google $16.8 million for “admissions leads generation.” In other words  advertising Liberty to those searching online for degree options. The recruiters work under intense pressure  according to several former L.U.O. employees I spoke with. They get no more than 45 seconds between calls  and sometimes managers override even that short break. There are no formal quotas — a federal regulation that went into effect in 2011 forbids them. But as one former employee put it  the “highly motivated goal” is for each recruiter to sign up eight new students a day. Multiplied across 300 cubicles  that is 2 400 per day. Of those  only a small fraction end up paying and starting courses  but that is still an extraordinary haul for any kind of education business. Every day  according to the former employee  managers send out a report showing the previous day’s tallies. Recruiters who signed up four or fewer new students get their names in red  visible for all to see  and are sometimes subject to a disciplinary conversation. Monthly tallies are also scored as green  yellow or red. Top performers are in the running for a small raise from the base salary  which is about $30 000. “It was that carrot and stick ” the former employee told me. A separate division of about 60 people focuses on courting members of the military  who have access to even greater federal tuition assistance  and then advising them on campus. A former employee in that division said that given the smaller crew  the work there was if anything even more intense than in the main branch: More than 30 000 L.U.O. students are from the military or military families. Two recruiters told me they were instructed to quote L.U.O.’s cost on a per-credit basis  rather than per-course  which makes it sound more affordable. Undergraduate courses for part-time students are $455 per credit  or $1 365 for a typical course  master’s courses are typically about $600 per credit. They are instructed not to press prospective applicants too hard on their academic qualifications. Applicants have to submit past transcripts  but any grade point average above 0.5 — equivalent to a D-minus — would suffice  said the former employee in the nonmilitary division. Recruiters  he told me  “would say  ‘Congratulations  you’ve been accepted.’ They’d make it seem competitive.” The two recruiters also said they were told not to mention Liberty’s Christian orientation until people agree to apply  when this fact is made clear in the user agreement they sign online. It also becomes clear at the moment that the recruiters sign up students for their first classes  typically an orientation class and three required Bible-studies classes. Students often can’t transfer credits for these courses to other colleges  which deters many from dropping out: Leaving L.U.O. without signing up for more courses would mean wasting the money spent on the first four. Advertisement Falwell and other top Liberty officials pushed back on some of these points in my interview with them  insisting  for instance  that the minimum G.P.A. for applicants is 2.0 and that recruiters are assessed according to “the same H.R. evaluation form that’s standard across the university.” But Ron Kennedy  the executive vice president for online enrollment management  acknowledged that the recruiters working under pressure to meet their targets might say otherwise. “It’s a call center ” he said. None Liberty  too  was hugely reliant on federal money  in the form of Pell grants  Department of Veterans Affairs benefits and federally subsidized loans. By 2010  it had more than 50 000 students enrolled and was pulling in more than $420 million annually. But because Liberty was technically not for-profit  it was spared many of the administration’s new regulations  including its requirement that a certain threshold of graduates be able to attain “gainful employment ” which was designed to hit for-profit colleges much harder. It was also spared from the pre-existing rule that for-profit colleges could get no more than 90 percent of their revenue from federal sources. If anything  Liberty benefited from the crackdown. The Obama administration’s actions helped put out of business large for-profit chains like Corinthian and ITT Technical Institute  clearing formidable competition from the field. Though there were other nonprofit institutions with online offerings — Arizona State  Southern New Hampshire and Western Governors  as well as premium players like Stanford and Duke — none were operating at Liberty’s scale. The university now touts itself on its website as “the largest private nonprofit university in the nation.” In a sense  said Ben Miller  who served as a senior policy adviser in Obama’s Department of Education  the crackdown on for-profits offered Liberty a “marketing advantage.” Falwell was candid about the benefits of the nonprofit status. “It insulated us from the attack on the for-profits ” he told me. And it put him on the same footing with other  more established universities. “There’s no way that an Obama federal government that probably doesn’t care much for schools like Liberty can treat us different than Harvard or Yale or Indiana Wesleyan or the University of Maryland.” Liberty’s ability to distance itself from for-profit colleges was especially notable given that  by several key metrics  it resembled them more closely than the private nonprofits it was grouped with. The rate of Liberty graduates who default on their loans within three years of graduating is 9.9 percent  several points higher than the average for nonprofit colleges  though still below that for for-profit colleges. Most striking  though  is how little the university spends on actual instruction. It does not report separate figures for spending on the online school and the traditional college. But according to its most recent figures  from 2016  the university reports spending only $2 609 on instruction per full-time equivalent student across both categories. That is a fraction of what traditional private universities spend (Notre Dame’s equivalent figure is $27 391) but also well behind even University of Phoenix  which spends more than $4 000 per student in many states. It is also behind other hybrid online-traditional nonprofit religious colleges like Ohio Christian University  which spends about $4 500. In 2013  according to an audited financial statement I obtained  Liberty received $749 million in tuition and fees but spent only $260 million on instruction  academic support and student services. By 2016  Liberty’s net assets had crossed the $1.6 billion mark  up more than tenfold from a decade earlier. Thanks to its low spending on instruction  its net income was an astonishing $215 million on nearly $1 billion in revenue  according to its tax filing — making it one of the most lucrative nonprofits in the country  based simply on the difference between its operating revenue and expenses  in a league with some of the largest nonprofit hospital systems. Falwell  whose Liberty salary is nearly $1 million  does not apologize for those margins. Liberty  he said  is simply being shrewd about keeping costs down  while plowing revenue back into the university. He noted proudly that Liberty’s net assets are now $2.5 billion  up from just $150 million in 2007  when he took over. He said he was surprised more universities weren’t following Liberty’s example of increasing online enrollment by keeping instructional spending and tuition low. And he freely acknowledged that the online revenues were going to buttress the residential campus. From Falwell’s perspective  there was nothing wrong with the university’s benefiting so much from the online program. “As long as we’re keeping the quality up  we don’t think it’s a disservice to anyone ” he said. “All that is  is ensuring the future of the university.” Advertisement None None Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In his autobiography  Falwell made virtually no distinction between these students on the Lynchburg campus and those receiving their instruction remotely. All of them  in his telling  were being prepared for the same goal  to be “Champions for Christ ” as the Liberty motto had it. But many students on campus  at least  are openly dismissive of the online experience. They take some classes online  for the convenience of not having to drag themselves to class — and  they readily admit  for the ease of not having to study much. “People know it’s kind of a joke and don’t learn that much from it ” Dustin Wahl  a senior from South Dakota  told me. “You use Google when you take your quiz and don’t have to work as hard. It’s pretty obvious.” (Liberty says using Google during quizzes or exams is cheating.) None Chris Gaumer taught English courses both on campus and online at Liberty after getting his bachelor’s degree on campus in 2006. The difference between the two forms of teaching was startling  he told me. As an online instructor  he said  he was not expected to engage in the delivery of any actual educational content. That was all prepared separately by L.U.O.’s team of course designers and editors  who assemble curriculums and videotaped lectures by other Liberty professors. This leaves little for the instructor to do in the courses  which typically run eight weeks. “As professor  you show up and your job is to handle emails and grade ” Gaumer said. This helps explain why the instructors — the roughly 2 400 adjuncts scattered around the country  plus the Liberty professors who agree to teach online courses on the side — are willing to take on the task for what’s long been the going rate for the job: $2 100 per course. (Falwell Jr. said it will soon go up to $2 700.) Until recently  the course designers and editors  a team of about 30 people  worked out of the old Thomas Road Baptist Church — the congregation moved out of the former bottling plant years earlier — in a concrete room that got so cold in winter that they sometimes kept scarves and hats on. For editors  starting pay is now around $11 per hour. As L.U.O. boomed in size  they became so overwhelmed by the challenge of shaping hundreds of courses that L.U.O. decided in 2015 to focus designers and editors on the hundred or so highest-enrollment courses per term  leaving the maintenance of the remaining hundreds of courses up to the instructors themselves. One former editor recalled having a professor send a syllabus along with  essentially  an apology for throwing something together at the last minute. Gaumer  who now works at Randolph College in Lynchburg  said the steep drop-off in quality from the traditional college to the online courses was both openly acknowledged among Liberty faculty and not fully reckoned with. The reason was plain  he said: Everyone knew that L.U.O. was subsidizing the physical university. “The motivation behind the growth seems to be almost entirely economic  because it’s not as if the education is getting any better ” he said. Falwell acknowledged that Liberty’s faculty initially resisted the rise of the online program  fearing the degradation of academic standards. “The big victory was finding a way to tame the faculty ” he said. But he disputed that there was any great difference in quality. For one thing  he said  the university made sure that all of its online instructors “adhere to the fundamentals of the Christian faith  our doctrinal statement.” Physical distance was a challenge  he said  but online instructors overcame it by making an extra effort to reach out. “They spend a lot more time taking a personal interest in the students ” he said. None Her first marriage  to the father of her daughter  ended in divorce. In January 2012  her second husband suddenly vanished. Hart and her daughter  then 9 years old  lost their home shortly afterward  and she filed for bankruptcy. She and her daughter moved into her parents’ basement and got by with donations from her local Assemblies of God church  where she was active. In 2013  she signed up to take three courses at L.U.O. that would provide her with a certificate in communications  allowing her to become a full-time instructor at the community college  which would reimburse her L.U.O. tuition. Advertisement Hart  who had a master’s in communications and leadership through Pat Robertson’s Regent University  chose L.U.O. because of its affordability and Christian cachet. But in her years of teaching and taking courses  she said  she had never seen anything as flimsy as what L.U.O. passed off in its supposedly graduate-level courses. She had little interaction with the instructor  and the questions for the midterm and final exams were so arbitrary that it seemed to Hart as if they had been randomly generated by a computer program. She spent the open-book exams wildly flipping back and forth through the textbook and course materials trying to find the relevant passages. It was  she wrote to L.U.O. officials later  like “looking for Waldo.” When she wrote the instructor for the second class to ask about the test  he responded: “As to exam question  I have no clue how the final is run.” He said he’d get back to her. He ended his note  “Do remember that God is in control and he works all things for our good.” When Hart emailed the instructor for her third course  which had a closed-book exam  she confirmed Hart’s suspicions: “The exam questions are random.” Hart got good grades in the first two courses but was increasingly convinced she was paying for a meaningless experience. She sent an email outlining her concerns to the instructor and an L.U.O. academic mentor  adding that she might quit the third course. “We will certainly take your input very seriously ” the mentor responded. “May the Lord bless you richly in your studies and future endeavors.” Finally  Hart told the officials that she was withdrawing from the third course  even though she had been informed that she would still have to pay 25 percent of the cost. “My spirit has been so sick over what I have experienced ” she wrote. In late 2013  she filed a complaint with a little-known government agency called the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia  which oversees the state’s colleges. Between 2009 and summer 2017  L.U.O. students filed 49 complaints with the council  more than for any other institution in the state. For some  the problem was administrative bungling — L.U.O. registered them for the wrong class  or required a class it turned out they didn’t need  and so on. For some  it was endless technical or logistical troubles that kept them from being able to submit their assignments or get textbooks. For others  it was disputes about tuition and financial aid that left them feeling as if L.U.O. was demanding more money than was fair  and withholding their transcripts until they paid up. Several complainants said they were particularly taken aback by their L.U.O. experiences because of Liberty’s religious underpinnings. “I just expected that Liberty University being a Christian university ” they’d be more helpful  wrote a complainant who went to prison and then became homeless after a stint enrolled in L.U.O. He had been seeking to have his transcript released despite his still having a balance at L.U.O.  so that he could resume his education elsewhere  Liberty responded by recommending homeless shelters. “Liberty’s motto is they are a Christian school that is training champions for Christ and they are the light of the world ” another student wrote six years ago. “That motto needs to be revised.” The anodyne responses the students received from L.U.O. were frequently glossed with Christian bromides. To a student whose financial aid was suspended in 2015 after the student failed a course because the textbook didn’t arrive in time  an instructor sent “quiz tips that may help” that included “Eat a healthy meal before taking your quiz” and “Pray before beginning each quiz!” Other L.U.O. responses included language errors so extreme that they bordered on confusing: One administrator wrote in 2014 about a complainant’s having submitted work that “appeared to have been copied from an unsighted source ” while a professor responded to a student in 2012 that “no other acceptions will be made.” Other students were left simply to flounder  contrary to Falwell’s claims of close attention from distant instructors. Lydia Terry-Dominelli  who lives in a suburb of Albany  N.Y.  signed up with Liberty in 2013  when it looked as if she and her husband were headed for divorce and she was worrying about how she could support herself and her 9-year-old daughter. She decided to get her teacher’s certification and chose Liberty partly because she was an observant Anglican. “I was ready for something that had some kind of value system ” she told me. Advertisement In 2015  Terry-Dominelli failed a graduate-level education course when  she said  one of the assignments she submitted vanished from Blackboard  the online system used by Liberty. After twice failing a writing course and puzzling over what she was doing wrong  she asked the course instructor for an explanation. He wrote back to suggest that she might do better if she found a “new work space” like the local library. After she assured him that her apartment sufficed and the conversation continued  he wrote: “I wonder if you can’t find a great prayer group through L.U.O.?” Terry-Dominelli struggled further with confusing assignments in another graduate-level education course. She was starting to feel helpless over the lack of guidance. “I have prayed very hard  and what I keep being told is I am in the wrong place ” she wrote to the education instructor in late October of 2015. “Bless your heart. I am so sorry ” the instructor responded. “I will join you in prayer for you to have wisdom and discernment.” In early 2016  Terry-Dominelli was unable to access online the spring-semester courses she had registered for. She took it as a final sign and left Liberty  just a few courses short of the master’s degree she had borrowed more than $20 000 to pay for. In August 2016  having failed to establish a decent income  she moved back in with her husband. Lacking certification  she took a part-time job as an aide at a local elementary school. Unable to afford the loans she’d taken out  she filed for help under the U.S. Department of Education’s Borrower Defense program  which is intended for students who have incurred student debt after being misled by higher-education programs. (Her application is still pending.) She also filed a complaint with the Virginia agency: “I feel that I was being pushed out of the program and I need to know why ” she had written to one of her professors. The agency declined to take action  finding no clear violations by Liberty. “What’s killing me is that I went into this program to try to change my situation ” she told me  “and I’m worse off than I was at the beginning.” None None The Trump connection is not without risk for Falwell. Some people who worked for L.U.O. in late 2016 and early 2017 blamed it for a dip in applications at the time and said the decline led to an April 2017 leadership overhaul and the departure of many employees. Falwell told me that Liberty has deliberately brought online enrollment down to around 85 000  explaining that “we wanted to make sure we kept the student quality at a certain standard.” And he said that his alliance with Trump has only helped the university: “For every student we lost because of political concerns  we picked up two or three inquiries who support us because of that political stand.” Advertisement A relationship with Trump could benefit Falwell Jr. and Liberty in other ways too. One of the top orders of business for Trump’s education secretary  Betsy DeVos  has been to roll back Obama-era regulations on online-degree providers. She named a former official from for-profit DeVry University to lead the D.O.E. unit that polices fraud in higher education. Claims for student-debt relief under the Borrower Defense program are being considered at a far slower rate under DeVos  who is delaying by two years an Obama rule that would make it easier to file debt-relief claims. And DeVos is expected shortly to roll back several key regulations geared toward online providers: ones giving states regulatory powers over distance-learning programs  establishing clear standards for a credit-hour and requiring “regular and substantive” interactions between online instructors and students. Falwell told me that Liberty officials have had a major hand in some of DeVos’s actions: “A lot of what we sent them is actually what got implemented ” he said. None Falwell rejects such prosperity-gospel talk. “I’m not going to tell you that we’ve done better because we’re better people ” he told me. “What I will say is that we’ve always operated from a business perspective. We’ve treated it like a business.” And that’s what first drew him to Trump  he said: the kinship of one businessman to another. “I thought to myself  if there’s one thing this country needs  it’s exactly the methods we employed at Liberty to save the school and make it prosper  and that’s just basic business principles.” None None None None None None Go to Home Page » ,students and education
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/02/opinion/sunday/graduation-rates-wayne-state.html,When Your College Has Your Back Advertisement Supported by None The University of Texas had a problem — its undergraduates liked bright-lights  biggish-city Austin so much they didn’t want to leave. Or that’s the optimistic take on it. Many students were simply struggling to finish their degrees. Barely half of each class was graduating in four years. Most universities are in the same boat. Today just 40 percent of college students earn a degree in four years. This phenomenon is so common that educators now use six years  by which time 59 percent of undergraduates receive their diplomas  as the new normal. That’s bad news. The extra time slows many students’ progress toward an advanced degree or a good job. When students stay for an additional year  it costs them or their parents as much as $40 000  and at public institutions  taxpayers foot part of the tab. And with undergraduates lingering  there is also less room for other students to enroll. Most important  the longer it takes students to graduate  the more likely they are to drop out. David Laude  a former senior vice provost in charge of student success at U.T.  told me the school’s culture was opposed to four-year graduation rates. But after a Texas-size donnybrook that pitted Gov. Rick Perry  who was fixated on cost-cutting  against the president at the time  William Powers  a deal emerged in 2013. The Texas Board of Regents approved a tuition increase  gave the university $12 million and agreed to invest in programs to help students succeed. The university had already begun drawing up plans to graduate more students on schedule  but Mr. Powers raised the stakes by pledging that 70 percent of the Class of 2017 would graduate in four years. It was a wildly ambitious goal  but the university came close to reaching it. Last year it raised the on-time graduation rate to 66 percent from 61 percent. This year  the school is forecasting it will hit the 70 percent mark  helping to make room for more than 1 000 additional freshmen. Even more impressive  the gap between the campus-wide four-year graduation rate and the rate for low-income  black  Latino and first-generation students has been cut in half. Wayne State University  in Detroit  suffered from a far bigger headache than Texas did — too few of its students were graduating  period. In 2014  only a third of the undergraduates who had arrived six years earlier earned a bachelor’s degree. That’s about 40 percent lower than at Georgia State University  where the undergraduates have comparable backgrounds. For African-American students  the graduation figure was hall-of-shame-low 13 percent. A black student who went to Georgia State was more than four times likelier to graduate than if he or she had gone to Wayne State. The fault lies with the university. Focused on raising tuition revenue  Wayne State relaxed its admission requirements to add 20 percent more freshmen. Although the newly admitted students needed tons of help to have a prayer of graduating  they mostly got the sink-or-swim treatment. The graduation rate plummeted and the racial divide worsened. For several years  only a handful of black male students graduated within four years. But there has been a turnaround at Wayne State in the past three years. In 2017  47 percent of the students graduated within six years  making the university one of the nation’s fastest improvers. Still  only 20 percent of black students and 29 percent of Latinos received a diploma. “The goal for 2020 is that the achievement gap will be wiped out ” said Wayne State’s president  Roy Wilson  who was recruited in 2014 to clean up the mess. “It’s a moral imperative.” The gains at Wayne State and the University of Texas don’t depend on rocket-science-difficult strategies. Both schools simply started paying more attention to helping those who need it most. Using what’s called predictive analytics  U.T. analyzes mountains of data from former students’ records to identify those current students  many from low-income families  whose odds against graduating are greatest. It then lavishes them with support. Wayne State focuses on students with weak high school grades and SAT scores. Instead of waiting for struggling students to acknowledge they’re in trouble  these schools provide them with concierge service from the moment they arrive on campus. Advisers and counselors reach out  upperclassmen are hired as tutors  and “learning communities” of like-minded students offer a haven in the sometimes overwhelming big-campus environment. Bureaucracies that turned seemingly mundane activities like registering for classes into Kafkaesque experiences — “getting Wayned ” students at Wayne State used to call it — are being streamlined. None Initiatives like these build a “we have your back” community. They enable vulnerable undergraduates to realize that they’re not impostors  an all-too-common belief  and that they can handle the obstacles they’ll predictably encounter. These are wise moves  as psychologists have demonstrated that students’ chances of graduating increase substantially when they believe that they belong at the university and that  with effort  they can do the work. Why doesn’t every university make the same type of effort to help students succeed? “The force of inertia is strong  and other presidents cannot believe this is possible to fix ” William Moses  the managing director of the Kresge Foundation’s Education Program  told me. “This goes to the core of who they are and how they see their jobs. How can we take $40 000 from a student  knowing that he’s likely to fail? Are we like for-profit colleges that don’t care about the outcomes  only the revenue?” David L.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/02/us/central-michigan-campus-shooting.html,Two Fatally Shot on Central Michigan University Campus Advertisement Supported by None A gunman fatally shot two people at a Central Michigan University residence hall on Friday morning  sending police officers swarming to the campus and setting off a search for the suspect that ended early Saturday with an arrest. The episode rattled nerves at Central Michigan  where details were released slowly and students were told to take shelter inside dorms and classrooms for much of the day. Police officers said Friday that they were seeking James E. Davis Jr.  19 and a sophomore. They described him as a person of interest in the shooting and cautioned that he was “armed and dangerous.” The victims were identified as Mr. Davis’s parents  James E. Davis Sr. and Diva J. Davis  both 47. An Illinois state legislator identified the elder Mr. Davis as a police officer in Bellwood  a Chicago suburb. None Just before 1 a.m. Saturday  the university said the police had taken “the suspect in the shooting” into custody after a search that grew to include more than 100 police officers from several Michigan agencies and the federal Bureau of Alcohol  Tobacco  Firearms and Explosives. The university did not name the suspect in its brief statement  saying only that the person had been “seen and reported by an individual on a train passing through the north end of campus shortly after midnight.” None The shooting came just over two weeks after 17 people were killed at a high school in Parkland  Fla.  and amid a national conversation about gun control and gun rights. Near Central Michigan’s campus in Mount Pleasant  about 150 miles northwest of Detroit  public buildings and schools were placed on lockdown. Lt. Larry Klaus of the university police  said Friday that the younger Mr. Davis had been taken to a hospital by the police on Thursday evening for what “officers believed might be a drug-related” incident  perhaps an overdose or a bad reaction to narcotics. Lieutenant Klaus said officers had found clothing alongside railroad tracks that may have been discarded by Mr. Davis. The hunt for Mr. Davis and the lengthy lockdown complicated the beginning of spring break at Central Michigan and led to the postponement of a men’s basketball game. The game was later rescheduled for Saturday morning  but will be closed to the public. More than six hours after the shooting  police officers went building to building to evacuate students. Parents who arrived to pick up their students were initially told to wait at a hotel. As the search continued  Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan spoke alongside university leaders  promising assistance for students rattled by the shooting. “We had two people that were killed in a residence facility: that’s traumatic ” said Mr. Snyder  a Republican. “I hope everyone can rally and  to the degree you see something  say something.” Matt Stevens contributed reporting.

https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/05/us/ap-us-civil-rights-mississippi.html,"Mississippi College Giving Posthumous Degree to Black Vet Advertisement Supported by None HATTIESBURG  Miss. — The University of Southern Mississippi will award a posthumous honorary degree to a black U.S. Army veteran who was rejected when he tried to integrate the school decades ago. Clyde Kennard applied several times between 1955 and 1959 to what was then called Mississippi Southern College. His applications were blocked by state  local and college officials. In 1960  Kennard was falsely charged with taking part in the theft of chicken feed  and was convicted and sentenced to seven years at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman. While there  he was diagnosed with cancer but was denied proper treatment until he was critically ill. Under pressure of bad publicity should Kennard die at Parchman  Gov. Ross Barnett ordered his release in early 1963. Kennard died July 4  1963. He was 36. Kennard's legacy will be recognized Friday during commencement on the USM campus in Hattiesburg. ""This will be an important day for The University of Southern Mississippi as we award Mr. Kennard  albeit posthumously  with a degree representing the education he sought and so rightfully deserved "" Rodney D. Bennett  who has been USM president since 2013  said in a news release. ""As president of the university  and especially as its first African-American president  I am honored to be part of our institution's progress in moving toward this outcome."" On March 30  2006  Kennard was declared innocent of the crimes that sent him to prison. USM ultimately renamed its student services building in honor of Kennard and Walter Washington  the first African-American to earn a doctoral degree from the university. The university also established a scholarship in 2014 to continue Kennard's legacy. More than 40 students have benefited from the program. A Mississippi Freedom Trail marker telling Kennard's story was dedicated in February on USM's main campus in Hattiesburg. The Freedom Trail is a series of state-funded signs at noteworthy civil rights sites. USM has a second commencement May 12 in Biloxi.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/01/us/penn-wynn-cosby-metoo.html,University of Pennsylvania Takes Away Steve Wynn’s Honors. And Bill Cosby’s  Too. Advertisement Supported by None None None None The university announced the decisions a week after reports emerged that Mr. Wynn  a Penn alumnus and former trustee  had frequently demanded naked massages from female employees  sometimes pressuring them for sex  in one case leading to a $7.5 million legal settlement. Mr. Cosby and Mr. Wynn are among a string of well-known men accused of sexual assault or harassment  forcing colleges to reconsider tributes like honorary degrees  which are often bestowed on celebrities and business leaders with the hope of spurring major donations. None Several universities also said they would revoke honorary degrees to the television news personality Charlie Rose. Large contributions to universities often come with the expectation that the donor’s name will be prominently displayed on a building  so the accusations against Mr. Wynn presented Penn  an Ivy League school in Philadelphia  with a particular conundrum. Students had already begun making their feelings known about Wynn Commons  an outdoor area on campus named for Mr. Wynn after he made a $7.5 million donation in 1995. A protest was planned for Friday  and earlier this week  the word “Wynn” was vandalized with black paint. The university quickly covered it up with plywood  with only the word “Commons” remaining visible. None None In 2015  the university rebuffed calls to revoke Mr. Cosby’s honorary degree. At that time  the university said that while the allegations against Mr. Cosby were deeply troubling  “it is not our practice to rescind honorary degrees.” Before Thursday  Penn had not rescinded an honorary degree in a century  since it took similar action against Kaiser Wilhelm II and Ambassador Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff of Germany during World War I. In explaining the university’s decision  which was made by an executive committee of the board of trustees  Dr. Gutmann and Mr. Cohen wrote that once the committee decided that Mr. Wynn’s honorary degree  bestowed in 2006  needed to be revoked  it had to do the same with Mr. Cosby’s 1990 honor. “The decision to remove the name Wynn Commons could not be made independently of considering the other ways in which the university had previously recognized Mr. Wynn ” the email said. “It became necessary  therefore  to consider the appropriateness of Mr. Wynn’s honorary degree and any other honorifics Penn had previously bestowed.” “That decision in turn made it also clear that the multiple and highly credible charges involving Bill Cosby warranted the same action.” None None The Republican National Committee said it would not return Mr. Wynn’s contributions unless he were found guilty of the accusations  though the Republican Governors Association and several Republican members of Congress have returned his money or donated the amounts to charity. The University of Iowa announced plans this week to remove Mr. Wynn’s name from the school’s Institute for Vision Research  which Mr. Wynn helped fund with a $25 million donation in 2013. On campus Thursday  some students took photographs of the newly altered “Commons” sign  with traces of black spray paint still visible around the plywood covering Mr. Wynn’s name. Amanda Silberling  21  a senior from Boca Raton  Fla.  who has led campus activism on sexual assault issues  said that the school had become more attuned recently to concerns about sexual misconduct. “I think there’s definitely been a lot more dialogue on campus in the last few years ” she said  “about what role institutions like Penn play in setting examples for students and showing what a moral and ethical response to issues like this are.” As for Mr. Cosby  she said  revoking his honorary degree was a welcome gesture  even though it was late. None “Now that there’s somebody directly affiliated with the university  with their name all over the place ” he said  “they finally realize that change needs to be made  and we should probably go back and revoke Cosby’s too.” Jon Hurdle and Kenneth Vogel contributed reporting.
