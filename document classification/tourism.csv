https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/world/americas/peru-rainbow-mountain.html,Will Tourism Ruin the Rainbow Mountain of Peru? Advertisement None None At first glance  the mountain in the Peruvian Andes  with its bands of soil the color of turquoise  lavender  red-violet and gold  seems Photoshopped. But the otherworldly sight  standing 16 000 feet above sea level  is real. People living nearby call it Vinicunca  the Rainbow Mountain. The varicolored mountain  with sediment created from mineral deposits over millions of years  was discovered only about five years ago  locals say. But it has become a must-see attraction for hikers  bringing much-needed cash to the area but also prompting concern about possible damage to the previously unspoiled landscape. None Advertisement Santos Machacca  29  a mountain guide in the Cusco region  in southeastern Peru  said that the Rainbow Mountain might have been discovered only recently because of climate change. Advertisement “We have asked the elders that live in Pitumarca ” a town near Vinicunca  “and they said that the mountain was under the snow ” Mr. Machacca said in a recent interview. “Global warming has caused the ice to melt  and a colorful mountain appeared from under it.” Mr. Machacca  a member of the Q’ero community  said the mountain was an appealing destination for trekkers not only because of its beauty  but also because of the climate. “They love to go because when you are up there  you can feel the pure air and you forget everything and you connect with the Apus of Ausangate ” he said  referring to legends of mountain spirits watching over the Peruvian Andes. The big crowds have breathed new life into the economy of the remote region around the mountain  creating jobs for residents in the area  many of whom have been alpaca herders. Roughly 500 villagers have now moved back to their ancestral land  according to The Associated Press  in order to act as guides to tourists across the Andes. They charge $3 per person  bringing in around $400 000 a year. But there may be a high price to pay for the tourism boom. “From the ecological point of view  they are killing the goose that lays the golden eggs ” Dina Farfan  a Peruvian biologist  told The A.P. None According to Mr. Farfan  a severe impact on the environment is already evident. A swamp that had been a refuge for migrating ducks was turned into a huge parking lot for tourist vans. A 2.5-mile trail has been severely eroded by hikers. Advertisement And a Canadian mining company  Camino Minerals Corp.  has applied for mining rights in the area. A local Pampachiri leader  Gabino Huaman  questioned whether enough had been done to prepare members of the community to host and guide the tourists streaming to the Peruvian Andes. “We don’t know one word in English ” he was quoted as saying in The Associated Press  “or first aid.” The high altitude and long distance of the trail can make for a challenging hike  and tourists usually need to acclimate their bodies before beginning the trek to the top of the fluorescent mountain. To overcome altitude sickness  some people carry small oxygen tanks  while others resort to chewing coca leaves. John Widmer  an American tourist who visited Vinicunca in April 2017  detailed a “not so colorful experience” in a blog post dripping with irritation. “It was the bad weather combined with irresponsible guides  unprepared hikers and horrendous trail conditions that made this one of the worst treks we’ve ever been on ” Mr. Widmer wrote. He lamented the environmental destruction occurring from the large numbers of tourists  adding that “the beautiful and fragile alpine environment is getting completely demolished” by the hordes of eager hikers who journey to the mountain. “I’m ashamed at the fact that we  too  personally destroyed a bit of the Andes during our trek to Rainbow Mountain.” None None Go to Home Page » ,tourism
https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/09/us/09reuters-hawaii-volcano-tourism.html,"Latest Eruption a Disaster for Hawaiian Town's Lava Tourism Advertisement Supported by None PAHOA  Hawaii — A little lava was good for business in Pahoa  Hawaii during Kalauea's frequent eruptions over the past 35 years  say people who make a living from tourists who flocked to the town to see one of the world's most active volcanoes. They mainly came to see the Kalapana flow  a stream of lava that flows from one of Kalauea's craters and cuts through an abandoned town of the same name on its way to the sea.  Kerry Kelly  70  a longtime resident of Pahoa  said the area saw a ""huge"" uptick in revenue as a result of the ""Kalapana flow"". It began in 1991  pouring into the streets  igniting homes  and burying everything in a layer of thick volcanic rock. The lava flow became a major tourist draw  pulling hundreds of visitors a day. Residents began running tours by boat  bicycle and off-road vehicles. Vendors set up food stands. Then it stopped a few months ago  Kelly said. The latest series of eruptions  quakes and clouds of toxic sulphur that has forced hundreds of people to evacuate has made things worse. ""Business was already dropping  and then to have this happen ... This is not just a physical disaster "" said Kelly. ""We're bordering on an economic disaster."" Business has all but petered out  said Arianna Arakaki  21  who manages Pele's Kitchen  a popular restaurant. ""As soon as the lava started going off  business dropped off because everyone started saving money "" said Arakaki  a native Hawaiian who worships Pele  the Hawaiian volcano goddess. Lava tourism was essential to Pele's Kitchen  such as a flow that approached the town in 2014. Tour boat operators would bring visitors to the restaurant for breakfast after sunrise viewing trips  she said. ""I'm pretty used to lava flowing  but this is different. When people you know are losing their homes  it's different "" Arakaki said. The semi-rural wooded area had also become a magnet for newcomers looking to settle on the Big Island of Hawaii  home to about 200 000 people  who were prepared to risk living near an active volcano for more affordable real estate. Hawaii’s 4 028-sq.-mile (10 432-sq.-km) Big Island accounts for less than a fifth of the state’s tourism. State data show that in the first three months of 2018  it pulled in 16 percent of the $4.8 billion visitors spent in Hawaii  less than half of levels in Oahu and Maui. Amedeo Markoff  49  runs an art gallery and a group promoting Pahoa tourism and business. ""What a time to be that guy "" he said. For now the eruption was ""a business disaster "" said Markoff  although he has seen a few disaster tourists straggle into town. But he is cautiously optimistic the eruption will draw more tourist dollars to the area  just as the Kalapana flow did after devastating that town. ""Our town is at the epicenter of an amazing  phenomenal spectacle "" he said. ""It does put us in focus."" But he added  ""Any benefits to the community are far outweighed by the trauma to the community.""

https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/10/world/africa/ap-af-tanzania-maasai-threatened.html,"Tanzania's Maasai Evicted in Favor of Tourism  Group Says Advertisement Supported by None KAMPALA  Uganda — Tens of thousands of Tanzania's ethnic Maasai people are homeless after the government burned their houses to keep the savannah open for tourism benefiting two foreign safari companies  a U.S.-based policy think tank charged Thursday. Villagers in northern Tanzania's Loliondo area  near the Ngorongoro Crater tourism hotspot  have been evicted in the past year and denied access to vital grazing and watering holes  said the new report by the Oakland Institute  a California think tank that researches environmental and social issues. ""As tourism becomes one of the fastest-growing sectors within the Tanzanian economy  safari and game park schemes are wreaking havoc on the lives and livelihoods of the Maasai "" said Oakland Institute's Anuradha Mittal. ""But this is not just about a specific company - it is a reality that is all too familiar to indigenous communities around the world."" Allegations of wrongdoing have persisted in recent years against Tanzania Conservation Limited  an affiliate of U.S.-based Thomson Safaris  and Ortello  a group that organizes hunting trips for the royal family of the United Arab Emirates. Young Maasai herders are so afraid of authorities that they ""flee when they see a vehicle approach "" thinking it might carry representatives of foreign safari companies  the Oakland Institute report said. Responding to the findings  Thomson Safaris said the ""awful allegations of abuse are simply untrue."" The company invested in Tanzania ""in good faith "" director Rick Thomson said in an email Thursday. Concern for the Maasai has been raised at home and abroad by rights groups such as Minority Rights Group International and Survival International  which has warned that the alleged land grabs ""could spell the end of the Maasai."" The Maasai  hundreds of thousands of cattle herders who inhabit the savannah in southern Kenya and parts of neighboring northern Tanzania  need land to graze their animals and maintain their pastoralist lifestyle. But the land bordering Tanzania's famous Serengeti National Park is also a wildlife corridor popular with tourists. The east African nation's government depends substantially on tourism revenue to finance its budget. The government has prioritized safari groups at the expense of indigenous communities  said Hellen Kijo-Bisimba  head of the Tanzania Legal and Human Rights Centre. ""The government has been reviewing boundaries and subsequently evicting communities in the name of conservation "" she told The Associated Press. ""In my understanding the conservation should have been made to benefit people  and if people are affected then it calls for worries. The Maasai community (is) indeed suffering."" A court in the regional capital  Arusha  ruled against Loliondo's Maasai in 2015 when it decided that Thomson Safaris legally purchased 10 000 acres of a disputed 12 617 acres in 2006. The Maasai appealed and the case is pending. Thomson  of Thomson Safaris  said in Thursday's email that ""witnessing"" the wildlife in Tanzania was a passion. ""But what made Tanzania so alluring was not just the wildlife  but the people "" he said. ""When people return from a safari with us  they say how magnificent the wildlife was  but that what was so extraordinary were the people they met."" Tanzania's Tourism Permanent Secretary Gaudence Milanzi denied the Maasai are being targeted  saying the government is working to improve their welfare by embracing modern methods of livestock keeping. ""There is no single group of people  say Maasai  who are intimidated  arrested  beaten or forced out of their land "" Milanzi said. ___ Associated Press writer Sylivester Domasa in Dodoma  Tanzania contributed. ___ Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ",tourism

After a week of rehearsals  contestants from 19 countries will take to the stage of the 20 000-capacity Altice Arena on Tuesday in the first night of the semi-finals of the show watched by an estimated more than 200 million people around the world. It will be broadcast simultaneously on giant screens on the city's main Commerce Square overlooking the Tagus river  where music lovers can party for free with live shows throughout the event until the May 12 finals. The Portuguese Hotel and Restaurants Association said hotel bookings had jumped 40 percent in Eurovision week and expected the event publicity to lure more foreigners. Reservations on the online lodging marketplace Airbnb soared over 80 percent from the same week of last year to 54 000. Portugal as a whole  and Lisbon in particular  have enjoyed a tourism boom over the past few years with arrivals spiking 12 percent to a new record last year  contributing to the once-bailed out country's strongest economic growth since 2000.  Dozens of new hotels and hundreds of apartments for temporary accommodation open every year  while a new cruise ship terminal unveiled in late 2017 doubled the number of arrivals by sea in the first quarter of this year from a year earlier. Pop star Madonna was last year among a growing number of foreign residents in Portugal  among them movie stars like Monica Belucci and Michael Fassbender. It is the first time Lisbon has hosted a Eurovision contest after Portugal's Salvador Sobral won last year's contest in Ukraine's capital Kiev.  This year's favorites include Cypriot singer Eleni Foureira with a fiery song ""Fuego"" and Israel's Netta Barzilai singing ""I'm Not Your Toy""  a fast-paced dance mix with a women's empowerment twist. The event also marks the return of Russia after it boycotted the contest last year amid tensions with Ukraine following Moscow's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea in 2014. It will be represented by Julia Samoylova who was unable to take part in 2017  singing ""I Won't Break"".

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/business/catskills-tourism.html,In the Catskills  New Hope for the Return of Tourism Advertisement Supported by Square Feet None None The Pines resort  where Ms. Greco Sunshine  a professional singer  made her regional debut in 1970 at the age of 10  and which closed in the late 1990s  is now a rotting hulk. None None “Some think the casino has arrived a little late because people have already sold their homes and gone on to do other things ” Ms. Greco Sunshine said. “But those of us who stayed are hoping the whole community benefits.” The casino is not the only tourism-focused project to stir hopes of renewal in the struggling county  a landscape of low hills about two hours from New York. Developers are working on or have completed a string of resort and hotel projects  including a gleaming new yoga retreat  a converted former furniture store and a renovated lakeside boardinghouse. It is contributing to a small but significant increase in the number of hotel rooms  according to the Sullivan County Visitors Association. After remaining flat for more than a decade  the number of rooms has jumped 25 percent in the past few years and now totals 2 100 across about 50 properties  the association said. None None None Few seem willing to go out on a limb and predict that the revived hospitality business will lead to widespread growth. After all  the county’s comeback has been heralded before. But the signs of progress can seem heartening. “We’re just at the beginning of this ” said Marc Baez  the president of the Partnership for Economic Development in Sullivan County  a nonprofit organization that lends to small businesses and matches developers with land and tax-incentive packages. And yet  “there’s a certain different mood when you drive around the county  from the average resident up into the business community ” Mr. Baez added. Much of the optimism seems to focus on jobs. Though it has dropped considerably in recent years  the county’s jobless rate in January was 6 percent  versus 4.1 percent in Manhattan. That rate could dip further because of Resorts World Catskills  whose site was owned in recent years by the Concord Resort Hotel  a once-grand getaway that has been razed. Of the 1 000 people who work at Resorts World  which is connected to an 18-story  332-room hotel  about 600 are from Sullivan County  said Ryan Eller  the chief executive of Empire Resorts  the owner. And when other hotels and amenities like an indoor water park and a golf course open on the property by spring 2019  resulting in a total of about 800 rooms  the $1.2 billion project will employ about 2 200 people  Mr. Eller said. But jobs could be in jeopardy if business falters  critics say. And the casino may have competition. None Mr. Eller said the competitors did not offer the same family-friendly amenities. “This goes beyond pure gaming ” he added. None On a weekday afternoon in March  the parking lot at Resorts World Catskills had about 200 cars but was not full. Mr. Eller declined to share attendance figures but said snowy weather was probably dampening totals. “We’re pleased with the amount of visitation that we’ve seen ” he said. The county has been generous with tax incentives. Officials defend them as necessary to attract business. None The $165 million project  which is to open in May  is expected to create 200 full-time jobs  said Mr. Chandra  who considered sites in Massachusetts and on Long Island before arriving upstate. Named for the Sanskrit word for “youth ” Yo1 will offer yoga  acupuncture and meditation classes  Mr. Chandra said. Situated on a slice of the former Kutsher’s Hotel and Country Club  a popular borscht belt resort that closed in 2013  Yo1 is just a piece of Mr. Chandra’s development plans for the huge property. Eventually  the 1 400-acre site will have a convention center with its own hotel. And that center will repurpose three Kutsher’s buildings that Mr. Chandra left standing when he otherwise cleared the site  including a racquetball complex. “Our theory is that nothing is permanent in life ” he said. By emphasizing wellness  as opposed to shuffleboard and stand-up comedy  Yo1 brings the region’s tourism back to its origins  said John Conway  Sullivan County’s historian. Beginning in the 1830s  the county was a refuge for city dwellers seeking a healthier environment  especially to rebound from tuberculosis  Mr. Conway said. Those visitors stayed in rustic retreats and engaged in activities like fishing  he added. It was not until after World War II that the all-inclusive  and indoor-focused  resorts sprang up  he added. “This was the ‘fortress hotel’ that became the standard for Las Vegas casinos ” Mr. Conway said. It’s the period before the borscht belt that informs Sims Foster  a co-founder of Foster Supply Hospitality  which owns four small hotels in the more-rural western part of the county  where Mr. Foster grew up. None “Building a new building on top of the hill is going to make everybody nervous ” Mr. Foster said. Other locations include the Nine River Road  on the Delaware River in Callicoon  an 1880s former furniture store that is now an eight-room hotel. Mr. Foster  who works with his wife  Kirsten Harlow Foster  is at work on a fifth property  a former boardinghouse in Kenoza Lake that will have 17 rooms. Twelve cabins will also be offered on the 55-acre property when it opens in 2019  he said. Hotel developers say some benefits will be indirect. After being introduced to the area  guests could be inspired to buy second homes  they say. Already  weekenders have helped revitalize the commercial districts in places like Narrowsburg and Livingston Manor  whose tiny downtowns have a vibrant mix of bistros and housewares shops. Buying a weekend retreat certainly would not be a new trend. As it is  the population of 70 000 in Sullivan County almost doubles when weekenders are counted  Mr. Baez said. Some part-timers even live in old-time bungalow colonies that went co-op years ago. None And if anything  the new hotels  with workers from elsewhere in some cases  seem to be stimulating the rental market. “It’s too early to tell” what the effect of the new tourism infrastructure will be  Ms. Curreri added. “But there are a lot of really good things happening in the entire county ” she said  “and they’re all positive.” Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,tourism

Shooting incidents injuring or killing bystanders have occurred ” the advisory stated. None “Tourism is the main industry for the state of Quintana Roo  which is why our main concern is to provide security and ensure travelers have great experience because we want them to come back ” Mr. Flota Ocampo said. Some 16.9 million visitors came to the state in 2017  an increase of 5.3 percent over the year prior  according to the state tourism board. Over 52 percent of those arrivals were repeat visitors. Told to exercise caution  Americans have continued to travel to the Yucatán. Whether it was the very cold winter endured in the northern United States  or the number of deals coming from the rapidly growing destination (some 14 000 hotel rooms are currently in development)  tourism has shown resiliency. In the first quarter of 2018  hotel occupancy in Cancún stayed level with 2017 figures at a healthy 77 percent  even though the room inventory grew by 3 percent this year  according to STR  Inc.  a travel research company that tracks hotel data. Travel agencies report strong interest in the region. AAA Travel predicted that Cancún would be its most popular international destination for family travelers this year. None None “There’s a lot of hesitancy  but there’s resiliency ” said Jack Ezon  the owner of the agency.

The Cruise Line Industry Association said a record-setting number of over 1 million cruise visitors are expected in Juneau this year. About half of those visitors are expected to go to the glacier. Projections released earlier this year estimate a 200 000 visitor jump for Juneau in 2019  a 19 percent increase. Designers hope a new hub of a visitor center next to the main parking lot will help spread out the crowds. The idea is to create a natural flow of visitors to the new facility  where they'll get information about what they want to do  and from there  disperse. Corvus Design landscape architect Peter Briggs showed off the concept for the new visitor facility at the unveiling meeting on Thursday. The new center would be built where a pavilion next to the parking lot currently stands  Briggs said  an ideal location for visitors arriving by bus. Building the center in that area would entail tearing down the old pavilion. ""The existing pavilion doesn't necessarily serve its ideal purpose and it's in this great real estate. So one of the ideas is that an existing visitor center would go where the pavilion is "" Briggs said. Public input is being accepted for the next few weeks. The full plan will be posted afterward  and then the Forest Service will begin a National Environmental Policy Act review. ___ Information from: Juneau (Alaska) Empire  http://www.juneauempire.com Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ",tourism
https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/11/business/11reuters-cuba-tourism.html,"Despite Hurricanes and Trump  Cuba Retains Charm for Foreign Tourism Firms Advertisement Supported by None HAVANA — New U.S. travel restrictions and a destructive hurricane season last year sucked some air from Cuba's tourism boom but foreign businesses from Spain's Melia Hotels to China's Jin Jiang are pursuing new investments in what remains a promising frontier. According to sources with knowledge of industry figures  tourist arrivals in the first three months of the year fell to roughly 1.4 million compared with 1.5 million in the same period of 2017. Of that figure  177 000 people arrived by sea and spent relatively little money onshore  an increase of 38 000 from the previous year  as foreign cruise lines stepped up their visits. The downward trend continued in April  the sources said  the tail end of the November-to-May high season in Cuba. Yet hospitality companies including Spain's Melia Hotels International and Iberostar Hotels & Resorts  Singapore’s Banyan Tree Holdings Ltd. and Apollo Global Management LLC’s Diamond Resorts International Inc. have all announced new projects.  Representatives of the companies often complain about the impossibility of owning their properties outright and the local bureaucracy  but acknowledge they make a profit. ""Cuba was  is and will be a key tourism area so it is just a matter of timing "" said Eric Peyre  who represents Louvre Hotels SAS  a French subsidiary of China’s state-owned Jin Jiang International Hotels Development Co  one of the world’s largest. Peyre  who has worked in the Cuban tourism industry for 25 years  said the company just took over one hotel but plans to have 10 within a few years. ""Every hospitality company will come to Cuba one day or another and we have decided to enter now "" he said. Over the last two years more than a dozen cruise lines have also arrived  including U.S. leaders Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.  Carnival Corporation and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. <RCL>  which have steadily increased their Cuba stake. ""United States cruise lines continue to add sailings and increase the size of vessels on the routes "" said John Kavulich  president of the New York based U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council  who follows the sector. He said the main restraint on growth was port capacity in Cuba. The dip in tourism revenue this year is painful for Cuba's Communist-run government  which is struggling with declining export revenues and dwindling support from crisis-hit ally Venezuela.  The Trump administration has made it more difficult for people to travel to Cuba  banned Americans from patronizing military-owned establishments and issued a travel warning that it may be unsafe to visit Cuba.  HAVANA HARD HIT  Havana was particularly hard hit as the number of American tourists dramatically declined  leaving once overflowing hotels and restaurants with plenty of room to spare. The U.S. trade embargo restricts Americans to cultural  religious and educational tourism or family visits  thus making Havana  and not beach resorts  a top draw for U.S. visitors.  U.S. visitors  not including those of Cuban origin  fell to 98 000 in the first three months of the year versus 160 000 a year earlier. Of those  25 000 came on cruise ships  twice the number during the same period in 2017  the sources said. Nevertheless  there are five new five-star hotels under construction in Havana  three of which broke ground recently.  The hotels are all owned by the military-run Gaviota hospitality corporation and will be managed by foreign firms. The Trump administration has forbidden U.S. citizens from patronizing Gaviota.  Other hotels in the Cuban capital are undergoing renovations. Most are owned by non-military tourism companies  such as the famous sea-front Hotel Habana Riviera built by U.S. mobster Meyer Lansky on the eve of the 1959 revolution. ""Everybody is planning long term. That is why the Cuban government is building in Havana and all foreign companies are asking how to be part of this development "" Peyre said. Foreign businessmen and local experts say 2017  with a booming 26 percent growth in arrivals before Hurricane Irma hit in September  was a fluke and so this year’s downturn is not the end of the world. Despite the hurricane's impact  arrivals for last year as a whole rose 16 percent.  ""We are very pleased that we can show the world that for us Cuba is indeed the next big frontier market and a great place to invest "" said Sebastiaan Berger  CEO of Ceiba Investments  a Guernsey-incorporated company with close to 20 years experience in Cuba and a $175 million portfolio. Ceiba announced this month a $150 million project to upgrade four joint-venture hotels and build a fifth with Cuban partner Cubanacan and Melia Hotels International. The Melia Habana Hotel will add 168 rooms. Berger  like Peyre  was unperturbed by the Trump administration. ""We are a company dedicated to investments in Cuba and have been investing in real estate under Presidents Bush Sr.  Bush Jr.  Bill Clinton  Barack Obama and now Trump "" he said. (In 19th paragraph  corrects to ""1959 revolution "" not ""1958 Communist revolution""  in last paragraph  corrects spelling of Obama's first name to Barack  not Barrack.)

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/smarter-living/how-to-get-rid-of-holiday-stains.html,How to Get Rid of Holiday Stains Advertisement Supported by None The holidays are many things: Festive  indulgent  an utter mess. And that indulging  as we all have learned one way or another  can wreak havoc on our clothes and table linens. More than almost any other time of the year  the holidays are packed with special occasion foods and drinks we consume that create particularly egregious stains. If your holiday festivities result in all new stains  spills and messes you’d rather not bring into 2018  here’s how to clean them all up. The holidays invite a lot of extra grease stains — delicious  buttery  oily grease stains. When a grease stain happens  such as when pan drippings splatter on your clothes as you transfer the turkey from the roasting pan to its serving tray  massage a small amount of dish soap into the fabric and flush it with cold running water. Dish soap is designed to cut grease and has the built-in benefit of already being in your kitchen with you and your oily stains  making it convenient for spot-treating. Of course  if a blob of gravy lands on the tablecloth as you’re ladling it all over your mashed potatoes  you shouldn’t be expected to dash to the kitchen. (The potatoes will get cold!) To treat older or more serious grease stains  dab a small amount of Lestoil or Pine Sol on the stain before laundering the item in cold water. Because a grease stain can be obscured when fabric is wet  it’s best to air dry  rather than machine dry  because the heat can set stains. If the stain lingers after laundering  retreat it the same way and wash again  sometimes a second treatment is all a stubborn stain needs to be coaxed out. For older  more set-in grease stains or spots on items that can’t be laundered  cornstarch or talcum will pull up the oil. Simply pile it onto the stain and leave it undisturbed for 12 to 24 hours  then brush away the powder and wipe any residue away with a damp rag or sponge. Speaking of those potatoes! Starches present a problem because of their tendency to become so glue-like. Before laundering  scrape as much of the starchy food off the fabric using a butter knife or the edge of a spoon then flush with cool water to reconstitute the dried-on starch. Then  treat with a small amount of dish soap  liquid laundry detergent or a stain pretreatment product and launder. Dairy should be flushed with cold water then treated with an enzyme-based stain remover (like Zout) and laundered. It’s important to stick with cold water when treating dairy  whether on your clothes or on the dishes  because hot water will cause dairy to become gummy  making it more difficult to wash away. While you might be tempted to lick stray chocolate straight off your table linens  there’s a better way. Shout spray is excellent at quickly removing chocolate from textiles. To use it  saturate the stain with Shout and rub the stained portion of the fabric against itself to work the product in. Then hold the fabric taut under cold running water and rub it against itself under the stream. None For splatters and spills on carpeting and upholstery  pour a small mound of salt on the area and let it sit. Salt acts as a desiccant  so it will absorb that fresh wine stain. When a coffee or tea spill happens  start by flushing the area with running water to push as much of the stain out as possible. Then use dish soap and a light-colored rag or sponge to scrub at the stain  which should come out without too much trouble. If a guest gets lipstick on your good napkins  don’t panic: Good old rubbing alcohol will take it right out. Apply the rubbing alcohol to cotton ball  rag or light-colored sponge and dab at the lipstick stains. Several passes might be required  so be patient. If the stain has lightened but a bit of pigment remains  apply a small amount of liquid laundry detergent and wash the item in cold water  checking that the stain is completely gone before drying. There are two approaches to removing melted wax from textiles  hot and cold. The choice of method depends on what the wax has gotten on  there will be items that lend themselves to one approach or the other. To use heat to remove wax  turn an iron on the lowest heat setting  lay a sheet of brown paper over the wax and place the iron on top of the paper. As the heat melts the wax  the paper will absorb it. Depending on how large the wax spill is  you may need to rotate the paper as sections become saturated. If the wax isn’t melting enough to absorb into the paper  dial up the iron’s setting. For hard surfaces like countertops  tables and floors on which you don’t want to set an iron  a hairdryer can be used to soften wax. When it’s pliable  simply wipe it away with paper towels and treat any waxy residue with a small amount of soap and water. Freezing will cause wax to contract  making it easy to pop off textiles and small items using a fingernail  butter knife or the edge of a spoon. Wax-covered items can either go directly into the freezer or you can apply ice cubes or packs to freeze the wax. Carving mishaps (or political disagreements) might leave you in need of methods for cleaning a blood stain out of table linens or clothing. There are many ways to remove blood stains  but here are four that will serve most of your needs. Hydrogen peroxide is a traditional go-to for blood-stain removal  and it is indeed quite good  but be aware that it can have a bleaching effect on some textiles. Therefore  it’s critical to test it out in an inconspicuous spot to make sure it won’t cause color loss. The combination of cold water and salt is also great for getting out blood stains  and it’s convenient for times when you can’t get to more traditional stain removers like laundry detergent or pre-treatment sprays. Get the stained item wet  pour salt on the stain  rub the salt into the fabric and flush the item with cold water. Enzymatic stain removers like Zout can be used to effectively treat blood stains on launderable items  while unseasoned meat tenderizer  which contains enzymes that break down blood  can be mixed with water to form a paste that’s especially good at treating older  more set-in blood stains. Apply the paste  allow it to penetrate the stain for 30 minutes  rinse with cold water  then launder as usual. None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,tourism

The Warriors can advance to the conference finals with a win at home on Tuesday night. Warriors guard Stephen Curry said it was apparent early that getting the ball to Durant would be wise. “Just find ways to get him in scoring positions ” said Curry  who had 23 points. “Sometimes  that’s not really hard to do — just throw it to him.” The Warriors lost by 19 in Game 3 on Friday  and the Pelicans were looking to even the series. Instead  the Warriors responded with a resounding effort that produced a wire-to-wire win with leads as large as 26 points. Klay Thompson scored 13 points  and Quinn Cook  a former Pelicans reserve  contributed 12. Draymond Green had 8 points  9 rebounds  9 assists  4 steals and 2 blocks. With his fourth rebound  Green became the third player in Warriors history to reach 800 playoff rebounds. Wilt Chamberlain (922) and Nate Thurmond (896) are the only others.

At least one person was believed to have died. The collapsed building  which reached more than 20 stories high  was a former federal police facility that was inhabited by about 150 squatters  city officials said  but it appeared that the vast majority of them escaped the blaze. The blaze highlighted the shortage of affordable housing in the city.

A person was trapped on an upper floor and was calling for help when the building collapsed  and it is very likely that the person was killed  a spokesman for the São Paulo Fire Department said. He said firefighters had conducted interviews with many people who had lived in the building intermittently  trying to determine whether anyone else might have been inside when it collapsed. “We had 167 men on location when it happened — that is a huge deployment for us ” said the spokesman  who is not authorized to give his name. “What happened today was a tragedy.” No bodies have been recovered from the ruins. Brazilian media reported that one firefighter was injured. None Video shot from a nearby structure showed flames spitting from the lower and middle floors before a sudden collapse.

https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/07/sports/basketball/ap-bkn-pelicans-problematic-pace.html,"Pelicans' Preferred Pace Presents Dilemma vs. Warriors Advertisement Supported by None NEW ORLEANS — The Pelicans' penchant for pushing the pace looks more and more like a quixotic mission to out-Warrior the Warriors. That's been the dilemma for Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry as New Orleans has slid into a 3-1 hole in its Western Conference semifinal playoff series against defending champion Golden State. Although there'd be logic to slowing the game down to limit shooting opportunities for Golden State's prolific perimeter players  Gentry never saw that option as practical enough to pull off in the playoffs. ""We're going to play at a fast pace "" Gentry says. ""I know some would say  'You're kind of playing into Golden State's hands. But this is the way we've played the whole season  so we're not going to all of a sudden try to adjust and do something completely different  because the success we've had has been based on playing at a fast pace and being a team that has played the fastest pace in the league. ""We don't have the ability to all of a sudden change that and become a walk-it-up-the-court team "" Gentry continued. ""We're just going to continue to attack."" The Pelicans found a measure of vindication in Game 3  when the Warriors had an off night shooting and New Orleans won by 19 points. But in Game 4 on Sunday  the Warriors ramped up their defensive intensity  shot better and beat New Orleans by 20-plus points for the second time in the series. Now Golden State can close out the series at home in Game 5 on Tuesday night. Even when the Pelicans' had DeMarcus ""Boogie"" Cousins playing alongside fellow All-Star big man Anthony Davis in a lineup that revolved around that imposing front-court tandem  New Orleans played relatively fast. They averaged 101.5 possessions per 48 minutes  which ranked sixth in the NBA. After Cousins went out for the season with a left Achilles tear in late January  the Pelicans picked up the pace even more. During their final 34 games  they averaged 104.5 possessions per 48 minutes — a faster pace of play than any other team during that span. If Cousins remained healthy  slowing the pace somewhat  and punishing the smaller lineups the Warriors use to greatest effect  would be a more realistic option for New Orleans. But Cousins is not expected back on the court until after next season begins. And whether he's still with the Pelicans remains to be seen  New Orleans wants him back  but he'll be a free agent this summer. The Pelicans' current lineup features relatively young  versatile players who move well and can score from various spots on the floor  such as Davis  guard Jrue Holiday and forward Nikola Mirotic. They also have a point guard in Rajon Rondo who thrives when pushing the pace and quickly identifying favorable matchups in transition  or early in possessions. ""After we lost Boogie  we became the No. 1 team in pace and we're going to continue to be that same team "" Pelicans veteran small forward Solomon Hill said. ""For us to change with all the chips on the table would basically be defeating the purpose. If we're good at something  we're going to stay with it and if anything  we're going to try to perfect it. ""If we had Boogie out there  it would be different. We'd slow it down and execute some stuff "" Hill added. ""But we're not going to change for anybody. The way we feel like we can compete at the highest level is to continue to be who we are."" Gentry has always known what he's up against in this round of the playoffs. He was a lead assistant coach for Golden State's 2015 championship team before taking the top job in New Orleans. During the 2017-18 regular season  the Warriors ranked fifth in pace  averaging 101.9 possessions per 48 minutes  so an up-tempo game was going to take the defending champs out of their comfort zone. Warriors head coach Steve Kerr  who was Gentry's boss back in 2015  doesn't see the Pelicans' refusal to slow the pace as stubborn. Kerr sees Gentry doing the best he can with the personnel he has. ""You've got to do what's best for your team. You can't go against your team's character and change strategy in the playoffs "" Kerr said. ""You've got to be who you are."" ___ More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ",tourism

BREAKING AWAY After shooting poorly Friday night  the Warriors were eager to regain their rhythm and did so immediately. They hit six of their first eight shots  with Durant making his first three. ""He was attacking tonight right from the beginning and he was brilliant "" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""He found better spots on the floor with his aggression and created easier shots for himself."" Thompson and Curry each added early 3s. That  and solid defense that included Green's block of Rondo's layup  helped Golden State open a 10-point lead in the first four minutes. The Pelicans missed eight of their first 10 shots and trailed 20-6 after Green made Golden State's fourth 3. The Pelicans slowly ground their deficit down to seven by halftime — only to botch the opening of the third quarter. Rondo's bounce pass handcuffed Davis as he cut to the hoop for what looked like a thunderous dunk in the making. Moments later  Green fired a cross-court pass to Durant for a one-handed jam. Andre Iguodala and Curry followed with 3s  and in two minutes  the Warriors' lead ballooned to 15. GOING SMALL Kerr went with a different starting lineup for a third consecutive game. Green moved to center after starting at forward in Game 3  7-foot center JaVale McGee returned to a reserve role and Iguodala  who'd started games 1 and 2  returned to the first unit at forward. Curry  Thompson and Durant rounded out the starting five. ""Obviously  the lineup worked  but it's not about the lineup "" Kerr asserted.

They cooperate to mince unwieldy complex carbohydrates into bite-size pieces for all to enjoy. They share the artisanally crafted molecules needed to extract essential iron from their surroundings. They jointly construct a kind of slimy tarp  a biofilm  on a convenient surface like a pond rock or your teeth  under which the microbes then safely hide. Through teamwork and constant chemical communication  microorganisms shape the world on which we macro-organisms preen. Yet scientists have discovered that just as a big holiday sale can quickly crush the wisdom of a human crowd underfoot  so can a microbial village be infected with mass stupidity  to devastating effect. Jeff Gore  a biophysicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  and his colleagues Christoph Ratzke and Jonas Denk  report that when a sample of Paenibacillus sp.  a soil bacteria  is fed a diet of glucose and nutrients in the laboratory and allowed to grow at will  the microbes end up polluting their local environment so quickly and completely that the entire population soon kills itself off. None “The effect is so dramatic ” Dr. Gore said. “You have an exponential growth of the population followed by exponential death.” Within 24 hours of the onset of the death spiral  he said  “no viable cells were left in the entire culture.” It’s not that the microbes had exhausted their resources: Food remained to feed on. But in gorging heedlessly on the glucose bounty  each bacterium had secreted a steady flow of acidic waste into the culture medium  until the ambient pH level had plunged lethally low. “It’s a strong pH change ” Dr. Gore said. “The cells don’t realize what they’re doing in time to stop doing it.” Nor was Paenibacillus the only microbe found capable of committing eco-suicide. Testing a series of bacterial strains isolated from soil  the researchers found that about a quarter of them  if given the chance  would alter the acidity of their surroundings to the point of mass extinction. In each case  the researchers showed they could block the die-offs by either adding a buffer to the medium to sop up the acid or by slowing the reckless pace of microbial growth through modest applications of antibiotics. “This is a very important discovery ” said Jo Handelsman  who studies microbial diversity at the University of Wisconsin-Madison  where she directs the Wisconsin Institute of Discovery. “I didn’t think bacteria were so self-destructive  but this is a very simple phenomenon. The pH changes  and the bugs all die. How did we miss it all these years?” By the standard dogma  she said  inhibitory processes would intervene before an entire bacterial population is wiped out  with at least a scattering of microbes going quiescent  forming spores or otherwise waiting out the catastrophe until prevailing conditions improved. The new research suggests that extinction is more easily set in motion than previously thought  and that once it gets started  the responsible parties may be helpless to make it stop. Dr. Gore emphasized that the study was not a recapitulation of how microbes behave in the wild. They looked at individual isolates of bacteria  monocultures pampered with an assured source of glucose and freed of the need to contend with other microbes. In the real world of  say  a forest floor  “soil is a tremendously complex environment  with high bacterial densities and diversity and competing interests at play ” he said. Some bacteria are acidifying their neighborhood  while others turn it alkaline and still others expel politely neutral waste. That diversity  Dr. Gore suggested  likely keeps microbial populations from annihilating themselves under ordinary circumstances. The paper nonetheless illustrates the perpetual struggle found at every stratum of the natural world and its human hyperprojection: between cooperation and selfishness  the tribe and the individual — between the creation of a public good  like a siderophore agent for scavenging iron  and a public hazard  like acid waste. Nature is at best a fickle conservationist  and many animals can prove quite destructive to their surroundings. Flocks of parrots can strip stands of fruiting trees of all their seeds  risking the long-term viability of the very food source on which the birds depend. Elephants are endangered in much of Africa  but in some South African reserves like Makilali they are merry marauders  yanking down trees and denuding all visible vegetation at a dizzying rate. “It’s no surprise ” said Simon Levin  a theoretical ecologist at Princeton University. “Organisms engage in actions that provide short-term benefits that ultimately can be damaging to the societies of which they are part.” And humans  well  where do we start? Digging up lead  forging it into water pipelines and adding it to cosmetics  paint  gasoline and other everyday goods before realizing that lead is toxic in tiny doses  especially to the brain. Dumping sewage into lakes and rivers and shoveling plastic waste into the ocean  where it swirls and accretes into a ghastly new continent. Burning ancient sources of carbon at a fever pitch and hoping somebody figures out what to do about our battered climate before Osaka and Miami disappear. Dr. Gore calls himself “an optimist” and points to positive trends in earth management: cheaper solar power  cleaner air and water in some places  tigers rebounding in others. “There are some bright spots ” he said. Still  humans are a monoculture  a single macrobial strain  with none but ourselves to keep the petri dish clean. None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,tourism

None None “If you know where to stay  dine and shop and when to visit  you can come to Rome and have an affordable luxury trip ” he said. Here are some of his best tips to do just that.  None None None None None A private guide is a pricey indulgence and worthwhile mainly if you’re interested in learning more about a particular topic  like historic architecture or art. But if you plan to hire one  do it during a weekday. During the week  guides in Rome cost usually around 20 percent less compared with weekends (and during low season  they can be up to 40 percent less).  If you’re in the city between May and October and want to hire a guide to see the Vatican Museum  do it on a Friday night  when the museum is open late. “A guide will charge a lower price on these Friday nights than during the day because it’s a lot cooler and less crowded ” Mr. Amorico said.  None But Mr. Amorico also suggested checking out the fashionable and well-priced clothes  shoes and handbags from lesser-known designers for great looks on a budget. They’re usually sold in independently-owned boutiques in Monti  Trastevere  Parioli and Fleming.  Finally  regardless of your budget  the best way to see Rome is by walking. Don’t bother spending your money on a car and driver or taxis  Mr. Amorico said. “Rome is like an open-air museum  and the only way to experience it is on foot ” he said.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/07/world/asia/bali-volcano-mount-agung.html,Bali’s Rumbling Volcano Leaves Tourist Industry Gasping for Air Advertisement Supported by None None The volcano sent huge plumes of ash into the air for two days late last month  temporarily closing the island’s Ngurah Rai International Airport. The volcano has since calmed down  at least outwardly  and the airport has reopened. But Ubud  a popular destination about 20 miles southwest of the volcano  has seen a sharp drop in visitors  as has much of the rest of Bali  Indonesia’s top tourism spot. “Business is superbad at the moment ” said Mr. Yanjun  35  who has been driving a taxi for seven years. “It is a very uncertain situation for us now.” None While nearly all of Bali’s resort hotels and tourist attractions are well outside the danger zone  uncertainty over future eruptions and possible airport closings has prompted many travelers to cancel planned trips to Bali or avoid it altogether. Tjokorda Oka Artha Ardhana Sukawati  head of Bali’s hotel and restaurant association  said that the island’s hotel occupancy rate is now at 20 percent  compared with 60 percent this time last year. Bali’s normally crowded beaches had only a handful of visitors Thursday and hotels were offering steep discounts to lure travelers back. That does not bode well for the tourism outlook as the island heads into what would normally be a busy holiday season. “Uncertainty is as much an enemy to the regional tourism industry as the actual eruptions ” said Keith Loveard  a senior analyst at the Jakarta-based firm Concord Consulting. Also affected is the neighboring island of Lombok  an increasingly popular tourist destination. Its airport has also been forced to close at times because of volcanic ash in the air  which can damage an airplane’s engine. Arief Yahya  Indonesia’s minister of tourism  said last week that Bali would lose about $665 million through the end of November because of the volcanic activity  which started increasing noticeably in September. Indonesia is unlikely to make its target of 15 million visitors this year  he said. The country’s goal of 20 million visitors by 2019 is also in jeopardy. Ubud  a picturesque town in the foothills  is surrounded by rice paddies and is popular with foreign tourists. On a clear day  Mount Agung is visible from some parts of town. The town center is full of art galleries  clothing stores  coffee shops  spas and yoga studios. Normally  the main street is choked with traffic and its sidewalks crowded with pedestrians. But now  Ubud’s hotels and shops have few customers and the streets are uncharacteristically devoid of traffic. Tour buses  typically ubiquitous  have vanished. Sales clerks  waiters and spa workers sit in front of their empty establishments  chatting with each other and offering their services to the occasional tourist who walks by. Many worry whether they will be able to keep their jobs. “This is the quietest I have ever seen Ubud ” said Dewa Septiana  25  a barista at a coffee shop. “Usually this street will be full of traffic. But since the airport closing last week  it has been empty here. Very empty.” I Made Gunarta  53  who operates the Yoga Barn  a yoga studio and guesthouse  said that his yoga classes typically attract 50 students but now have 20. The guesthouse usually has 80 percent occupancy but is now only half full. He is concerned that he may not be able to keep all of his 250 employees. “The impact of the eruption is very huge ” he said. “This definitely will hit the economy. The people who will be affected most by this situation are the people with the lowest income.” Some Balinese compare the current downturn to the aftermath of the 2002 Bali bombing  when Islamic extremists blew up a popular nightclub in Kuta and killed 202 people  mostly foreign tourists. The island’s tourist industry took years to recover and then suffered another setback in 2005 with restaurant bombings that killed 20 people. Desak Putri  44  who sells knickknacks at the popular Ubud Market  said she used to take in more than $200 a day  but now is lucky if she sells $15 worth of merchandise. On one recent day  she sold nothing. “Even after the Bali bombing  it wasn’t this quiet ” she said. Tourists who have made it to Ubud  on the other hand  are taking advantage of the tranquillity — even if they feel a bit guilty. Two visitors from Britain  Steph Sorum  27  and Alex Jones  29  who are on their way home after working in New Zealand for two years  liked Ubud so much that they extended their stay. Sites that they expected to be overrun with tourists have turned out to be surprisingly peaceful  they said. “In our selfishness  we enjoy it ” Ms. Sorum said. Mr. Jones added: “It is devastating for the locals though. I mean if you walk by the street  and you know the guys offering taxis are desperate. I really feel sorry for them.” Muktita Suhartono reported from Ubud  Indonesia  and Richard C. Paddock from Bangkok. None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,tourism

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/us/virgin-islands-hurricanes.html,After Irma and Maria: How 3 Spots on the U.S. Virgin Islands Are Faring More than two months after the disaster on the U.S. Virgin Islands began  we checked back on some spots that we visited and photographed not long after the storms hit. None Supported by None Hurricanes Irma and Maria both hit the United States Virgin Islands in September as rare Category 5 storms  but the devastation there has been largely overshadowed by the damage and death this year’s hurricane season left behind in Florida  Texas  Puerto Rico and the Caribbean nations. None Gov. Kenneth E. Mapp said on Thursday at a news conference that he would go to Washington next week to request $7 billion in aid. After taking a group of senators on a tour of the destruction  he said in a statement earlier this week  “It is so critical that Congress sees firsthand the challenges we face in rebuilding our infrastructure.” More than two months after the disaster began  many residents are still grappling with daily survival  serious rebuilding remains. To see how different corners of the islands are faring  we checked back on some spots that we visited and photographed not long after the storms. _____ For two months  Kimmeiqua Mahoney  her husband  Shawn Mathurin  and their three children tried to tough it out in their waterlogged apartment on St. Thomas  without electricity  trying in vain to keep things clean. But they gave up and moved this week to a home where the power is on. Ms. Mahoney  25  was eight months pregnant when Irma ripped away their doors and windows  allowing the blast of rain into their old apartment. It was as if someone aimed a fire hose at everything inside  and left it running for hours  she said  two weeks later  Maria turned the hose on again. They have replaced or boarded over the openings  but the walls inside are “still wet to the touch ” she said. “The bathroom roof is falling apart. There’s a lot of mold  greenish and bluish  coming out of the walls.” Nearly everything they owned was ruined. An outer wall of their apartment  in a building in the Tutu High Rise Community  shifted in one of the storms  so the rooms flood anew with each rainfall. Their only way to cook was on a campfire  and with no refrigeration  they had to be careful to buy only as much food as they could prepare and eat each day. Across the islands  mosquitoes and flies proliferate in the standing water and rotting garbage  and like many people  Ms. Mahoney  unable to close her home to the elements  worries about a disease outbreak. Now  she has an added worry  an infant to care for — Trinity Luisa Mathurin  born in a hospital on Oct. 19. The baby’s arrival helped convince the parents that they had to move  Ms. Mahoney said  “because it’s not sanitary.” But she is acutely aware that others are less fortunate. She and Mr. Mathurin have been sheltering neighbors whose apartment lost entire walls  so that their furniture literally blew away. With many homes destroyed  their family is not high on the list to get a more intact unit in the Tutu complex  a public housing project — but that is as it should be  Ms. Mahoney said. The storms left their 2011 Toyota Yaris with shattered windows and soaked upholstery  but to her surprise  it runs. She used to work at a hotel  but the storms put it out of business. After a few weeks  roads were cleared and some cell service returned  so her husband  a painter  was able to reach his boss and return to work on repair projects. “It feels like we’re actually making a bit of progress ” she said. “But it’s still such a long  long way to go.” _____ The storms hit Cibone  a restaurant in the historic district of Frederiksted  on St. Croix  so hard that the owners  Almitra and Gregory Richards  have not even been able to assess the damage. “The landlord has workers in there making sure it’s structurally sound ” Ms. Richards said. “Until then  we can’t even get in to see if the equipment is O.K. and start serious cleanup. I think we can scrub down the furniture and salvage it  but we don’t really know yet.” Like thousands of other structures around the islands  the restaurant is topped by a blue tarp  covering a damaged roof. At least some buildings in the historic district still did not have electricity  their tenants said  but some businesses with generators and lighter damage have reopened. When Irma blew past  Cibone lost power and the food spoiled  so the staff threw it all away  cleaned  and stocked up with fresh supplies. Then it happened again with Maria. Ms. Richards  38  said they had no idea when they might be able to reopen  but the restaurant is not their biggest concern. Maria peeled the carport and part of the roof off their nearby house  and filled it with water. “I tried salvaging our clothes  and I got my son’s diploma  but almost everything else is gone ” she said. “The mold is pretty bad  so we wear masks when we go in there.” The family is staying with relatives  and trying to figure out how to pay for home repairs. Ms. Richards’s older son  Ahmad Williams  18  was visiting relatives in Baltimore when the storms hit  and for now  he is staying there. After the storms forced the islands’ schools to close  she worried that her younger son  Ahmil Williams  12  had too much time on his hands  and too little to take his mind off the devastation. St. Croix’s schools finally reopened in late October and early November. “We thought about sending him to stay with relatives ” she said  “but I think he needs to be with us.” _____ The Caneel Bay resort  a luxury vacation spot on St. John  was forced to cancel its entire November-to-August season  and lay off some 300 workers  said Patrick Kidd  the director of marketing. The 2018-19 season remains a question. “We had only about 30 rooms out of 166 that survived pretty much intact ” he said. “There are probably some buildings that will have to be completely demolished  while others can be repaired  but we won’t really know until we get structural engineers and architects in there to assess the prospects.” The resort has generators  so it has been able to supply food refrigeration and ice to some island residents  and it has provided accommodations for some recovery workers. In the last week  parts of the island’s power supply have gone back online. Mr. Kidd said he was struck by the patchwork pattern of destruction. “Some buildings were completely destroyed ” he said  “and others just nearby were pretty much intact.” None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,tourism

From the “Barely Touched” section  the scallop with Meyer lemon and caviar  yellow tail with ponzu sauce and fluke with raw green olives and snow peas — attractively presented in a large silver  octopus shaped ice bucket — were fresh and had the pop of spring.  From “Tapas Temporada” (Seasonal Tapas) the garlic shrimp  laced with brandy and presented in a pot of bubbling oil  was as good as the most memorable versions I’ve eaten in Spain  the steak-like grilled calamari with red peppers and onions was tender  not chewy  as grilled squid can often be.  I wanted to order the piquillo peppers stuffed with crab meat and topped with a sea urchin sauce  and my husband was tempted to get round two of the buttery scallop atop curried peas and potatoes  but our main course awaited  and I’m glad we saved some room.  Our server recommended that we go for one of the four seafood paellas made with the short-grain Spanish rice called bomba or pick a whole fish. The two-pound Spanish branzino had just arrived that morning  he said  and looked particularly tasty. We were sold: the simply grilled wild bass took me back to a vacation in Ibiza where I savored this same fish almost daily.  Compared with the preceding courses  dessert choices are more limited. In true Spanish style  there’s a flan  creamy and presented with a blood orange meringue  and a dairy-free house-made strawberry ice cream surrounded by a lemon-thyme compote.

Did you leave the coffee maker on? Or a door unlocked? Full-blown panic usually sets in about half an hour after you’ve headed out of town. With the arrival of peak vacation season comes the separation anxiety associated with leaving your most valuable asset — your home — alone for a week. And you have reason to worry. The list of things that can go awry in an unsupervised property is long  with potentially costly consequences. The most obvious risk: Someone breaks in and steals your stuff. But there are other reasons to lose sleep. A pipe or faucet could leak. A tree could fall. And there’s always that dreaded coffee pot. None For Mike Barnett of South Orange  N.J.  the intruder was an uninvited houseguest. One night in August 2013  he returned from a family vacation to Orlando  Fla.  to find his home ransacked. Items had been knocked to the floor while doors and windows showed signs of abuse. But nothing was missing and Mr. Barnett could find no signs of forced entry. Then the culprit revealed himself: a terrified and hungry squirrel. “It had obviously spent a fair bit of time running around crazy  plotting its escape ” Mr. Barnett said. The next day  an animal control expert trapped and released the rodent. Mr. Barnett never figured out how the squirrel got inside  but now he makes sure that doors  windows and the fireplace flue are closed and sealed. So far  no other furry creatures have visited. The damage to Mr. Barnett’s home was around $1 000  including about $100 to trap the critter. But the biggest loss was sentimental. An Air Force award sitting on the fireplace mantel survived two decades and countless moves  but not the squirrel. The statue  of an eagle  was knocked to the floor  shattering its porcelain wings.
