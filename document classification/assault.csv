https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/28/opinion/sunday/ida-b-wells-lynching-black-women.html,Ida B. Wells and the Lynching of Black Women Advertisement Supported by None None None The journalist Ida B. Wells protested the lynching in an editorial for The Gate City Press  a black newspaper in Kansas City  Mo. Eliza Woods “was taken from the county jail and stripped naked and hung up in the courthouse yard and her body riddled with bullets and left exposed to view!” Wells later wrote in her diary. “Oh  my God! Can such things be and no justice for it?” None The inclusion of black women who were lynched is an important step in the long struggle to acknowledge the violent history of racial and gender inequality. When most Americans imagine lynching  they envision the tortured and mutilated body of a black man accused of raping a white woman. They rarely think of a black woman “stripped naked and hung.” Wells  however  was well aware that black women were victims of Southern mob violence and also targets of rape by white men. In 1892  when mobs across the South murdered more than 200 African-American men and women  including one of Wells’s closest friends  she began to systematically investigate lynchings. As I’ve noted in my academic work  she soon discovered that few victims had even been accused of rape. In an editorial  she wrote that “nobody in this section of the country believes the old threadbare lie that Negro men rape white women.” In retaliation  a white mob destroyed her press and warned Wells  who was in New York at the time  not to come back or risk death. Wells was not intimidated. Instead  she crossed the country lecturing on the evils of mob violence. She traveled to Britain  where she started an international crusade against lynching. She initiated one of the first public hearings to address both racial and sexual violence. Wells also sought to protect black women against rape by white men. None In “Southern Horrors ” Wells made clear that white men perpetrated sexual violence against black women  while black men were brutalized by white mobs for having consensual sex with white women. And by showing that only about 30 percent of the black victims of lynch mobs had actually been accused of rape  Wells challenged the idea that lynchings resulted from it. She argued that the portrayal of black men as rapists put them “beyond the pale of human sympathy.” And she suggested that such a focus concealed the rape of black women. And it gave cover to whites’ violent efforts to rob African-Americans of their rights. Drawing attention to the sexual crimes of white men  she noted that chivalry “can hope for little respect from the civilized world when it confines itself entirely to the women who happen to be white.” Wells uncovered the long history of white men raping black women. “Not one who reads the record as it is written in the faces of the million mulattos in the South ” she wrote  “will for a minute conceive that the Southern white man had a very chivalrous regard for the honor due the women of his own race or respect for the womanhood which circumstance placed in his power.” Wells’s genius lay in her ability to flip the script  casting white Southern men as the lustful rapists of black women and the hypocritical murderers of innocent black men. Alone  she was not able to stop lynching. But with the help of other black women  she did put mob violence on the reform agenda and brought to light the rape of black women. Yet when most Americans remember Wells  they remember her solely as a campaigner against lynching. We hear little of the woman who linked economic exploitation  lynching and sexual violence. Erased is the person who believed that lynching was a way to control white women’s sexuality  especially those who had sexual relationships with black men. Gone is the radical feminist who insisted on women’s rights to sexual justice and equal protection. A history of lynching must remember black women like Eliza Woods. It should recognize that the rape of black women devastated communities. And it ought to highlight how black women organized against rape and lynching. Anything less prevents one of the most radical movements for racial and sexual justice from speaking to the many challenges of our time. The memorial and museum in Montgomery are long overdue. And they represent a call to action that begins with an acknowledgment of hidden truths. Crystal N.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/22/opinion/campus-sexual-assault-punitive-justive.html,I’m a Campus Sexual Assault Activist. It’s Time to Reimagine How We Punish Sex Crimes. Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor None I’ve told my story many times — I was assaulted  I reported it to my university  and it swept it under the rug. When I was 19  I helped create the wave of activism around the issue of campus sexual assault that made headlines from 2013 to 2016. The student movement during those years primed the public for #MeToo today: Survivors of sexual assault mobilized to end the stigma attached to it by telling our stories publicly. And  as is happening now  progress didn’t come without opposition. We’ve been here before  and there are valuable lessons from our fight for today’s movement. One of the most promising has to do with justice. Over time  many student activists have become disillusioned with an emphasis on punitive justice — firings  expulsions and in some cases  prison sentences. We’ve seen firsthand how rarely it works for survivors. It’s not designed to provide validation  acknowledgment or closure. It also does not guarantee that those who harmed will not act again. As the campus sexual assault movement  and now #MeToo  has made clear  sexual injustices  from harassment to rape and assault  are deeply ingrained in American society  involving people from all walks of life. We cannot jail  fire or expel our way out of this crisis. We need institutional responses to sexual harm that prioritize both justice and healing  not one at the expense of the other. When I was assaulted at 18  I knew clearly what I wanted: I wanted him to never violate anyone else again  ever. Four of us whom he’d assaulted told the university  through proper channels  he was eventually found responsible  but the punishment was negligible. Nor did it achieve my goal: He assaulted another person the weekend of his graduation. The whole process made me feel betrayed  angry and unvalued. It was worse than the assault itself. Later  when I got involved in campus sexual assault activism and did Q. and A. sessions around the country  people often asked me why I hadn’t then gone further  seeking to have him expelled or reporting him to the police. I always felt uncomfortable when asked these questions — it was as though I had to prove that my story was really “that bad ” as if I admitted I didn’t want him to go to jail  it would minimize his wrongdoing. The reason I gave for not reporting him to the police was that I didn’t want to go through a lengthy court process. While this was true  it was more than that: First  I wanted to get on with my life. But second  putting him in prison seemed almost laughably ill suited to what I needed. What I wanted was for him to change his behavior. He needed an intervention  not prison. He got neither. I had to fit my priorities into a box that was never designed to hold them  as do so many other survivors. Sexual injustices exist in many forms  from casual sexism and harassment to sexual assault and rape. But people harmed by them have  by and large  only two options: They can try to have the perpetrator formally punished  or they can do nothing. The process of reporting formally is important to many survivors and must be protected  we know  however  that a vast majority of people will not choose this path. And all survivors — regardless of whether a report is filed or a harm-doer is exposed — deserve justice  healing and trust. Recognition of the scale of sexual assault and harassment in the United States has  understandably  inspired a wave of outrage. Women who have watched known predators act without consequences for years are angry  as they should be. But it is this same factor — the scale of the problem — that ensures that cries for retribution on a mass scale are untenable. We’re simultaneously dehumanizing the people who committed sexual assault for years by calling them monsters and learning that the people who commit these crimes are our friends  co-workers  family members and partners. Such dynamics become too much to grapple with  as a result  the conversation devolves into an argument about whether #MeToo has gone “too far” versus “not far enough”  my fear is that this is where it will stall until we lose patience and move on  when what we really need is a new approach. None Academics are already building upon this sense that we need more options. At the University of Arizona  Mary Koss  who did groundbreaking work on campus rape in the 1980s  piloted a program called Restore that uses a framework in which the harm-doer takes responsibility for what happened and a formal plan is developed for the person to make amends and change his behavior. This approach also involves community members along with family and friends. Alternative forms of justice are also taking hold in contexts beyond campuses. In 2016  Black Women’s Blueprint  an organization that advocates for black women who are survivors of sexual violence  convened a Truth and Reconciliation Commission conceived by its members. The four-day commission gave 15 survivors the space to share their stories and be publicly affirmed by the community. It also created space for individuals  whether harm-doers or those who enabled them  to take responsibility. One minister apologized on behalf of the religious community for not believing or supporting survivors  which Farah Tanis  the director of BWB  called “tremendous ” “shocking to get” and “so important for so many survivors in the room.” She also noted that some men in attendance said that they had sexually harmed women and offered apologies  which took the burden off survivors to initiate reconciliation. None But if the momentum and passion behind #MeToo and the campus sexual assault movements demonstrate anything  it’s that our systems for dealing with sexual injustices are broken. The question is whether we are using this moment to construct better ones. None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,assault
https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/08/us/ap-us-child-sex-assault.html,"Prosecutor: Testimony of Child Enough to Convict Men of Rape Advertisement Supported by None SALT LAKE CITY — A prosecutor in Utah told jurors Tuesday that a young girl's testimony about being raped by three men while her mother was in a nearby garage smoking methamphetamine should be sufficient to find them guilty. The testimony of the girl  who was 9 at the time of the alleged assault and is now 11  was consistent  clear and damning  Uintah County attorney Mark Thomas said in a Salt Lake City courtroom during closing arguments. ""This is not someone who's making up a story "" he said after the five-day trial. ""There was no motive for this child to make this up."" Last week  the girl testified via video link that the three men raped her after a 2016 Easter egg hunt at a rural home then threatened to kill her and her family if she told anyone. The Associated Press generally does not identity people who say they were victims of sexual assaults. Defense lawyer Loni DeLand argued that the rape was fabricated by the mother  who was paranoid from smoking meth and angry at one of the defendants  former boyfriend Jerry Flatlip  31. ""That's pretty strong motive "" DeLand told jurors. The other defendants are Larson RonDeau  38  and Randall Flatlip  28. All three men face felony charges of rape and sodomy of a child. They have denied the allegations. Prosecutors did not offer any physical evidence such as blood or hair showing the girl had been assaulted. If prosecutors are relying solely on testimony from the girl and her mother  ""I don't think you or any reasonable juror could conclude that that's sufficient evidence or proof beyond a reasonable doubt "" DeLand told the jury. The mother has pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor child abuse charge for leaving the girl while she used drugs  and was sentenced to jail and drug treatment. The Associated Press is not naming the mother to protect the identity of the child. The girl is now in the care of her Native American tribe  authorities have said. Thomas compared the girl's testimony to that of women who leveled sexual assault allegations against comedian Bill Cosby. ""Bill Cosby has been convicted by the testimony of somebody who claimed to be his victim "" he said. ""No other evidence"" was necessary. Cosby was convicted of drugging and molesting a woman in 2004. The three defendants in Utah sat largely stone-faced during the proceedings  though Jerry Flatlip seemed to become emotional as his lawyer made the final appeal to the jury. Flatlip rocked in his chair  sniffled and wiped his nose with a tissue. Charges were initially filed against a fourth man but dropped when the girl's mother could not be found to testify at an evidence hearing in 2016.

https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/05/world/asia/ap-as-india-rape-killing.html,Indian Police Arrest 14 in Rape  Killing of Girl Advertisement Supported by None PATNA  India — Indian police on Saturday arrested 14 people suspected of kidnapping  raping and burning to death a teenage girl  the latest in rising crimes against women in India despite toughening of laws. District Magistrate Jitendera Singh said the accused abducted the girl from Chatra  a village in eastern Jharkhand state  while she was attending a wedding ceremony on Thursday. Some of them allegedly raped her before letting her go home. The village council leaders imposed a fine of 50 000 rupees ($770) on the accused the next day. Singh said the suspects beat up the girl's family members for complaining against them and burned her to death after finding her at home alone on Friday. Singh said police were searching for the main suspect in the case. India has been shaken by a series of sexual assaults since 2012  when a student was gang-raped and murdered on a moving New Delhi bus. That attack galvanized a country where widespread violence against women had long been quietly accepted. While the government has passed a series of laws increasing punishment for rape of an adult to 20 years in prison  it's rare for more than a few weeks to pass without another brutal sexual assault being reported. Responding to widespread outrage over the recent rape and killings of young girls and other attacks on children  India's government last month approved the death penalty for people convicted of raping children under age 12.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/nyregion/innocence-project-manhattan-rape.html,26 Years Later  Justice for Men Imprisoned for a Bogus Rape Advertisement Supported by None The woman  dirty  disheveled and in tears  ran over to a patrol car parked along a Harlem street in the early morning of Jan. 18  1991. She told police officers she had been kidnapped at knife point near her home in Queens and raped by three black men  whom she identified. Before the end of the month  the police arrested two of the men she had named — Gregory Counts  then 19  and VanDyke Perry  then 21. They were charged with rape  sodomy  kidnapping and criminal possession of a weapon  according to court records. The third man was never caught. Investigators had no physical evidence. Semen recovered from the woman did not match the two accused men. The prosecution’s case relied heavily on her testimony  which was inconsistent. The defense argued the woman  a recovering crack addict  fabricated the story to protect her boyfriend  who had shot Mr. Perry two months earlier and was wanted by the police  court records show. Yet  in 1992  a jury convicted Mr. Counts and Mr. Perry on all counts except for the weapons charges. Mr. Perry ended up serving 11 years in prison  Mr. Counts 26. On Monday  both men walked into a packed courtroom to hear the Manhattan district attorney  Cyrus R. Vance Jr.  ask a judge in State Supreme Court to vacate their convictions based on newly discovered DNA evidence and the woman’s decision to recant her testimony. “This wrongful conviction destroyed my life ” Mr. Perry said  wiping away tears. “But I never gave up my fight.” Mr. Counts broke down in tears as he entered court and hunched over a railing. “I can’t be angry ” Mr. Counts said  referring to his accuser. “If I waste a minute being angry it’s a waste of time. That’s a minute I could have been happy.” Last month  the woman  who has not been identified  told investigators from the district attorney’s office and the Innocence Project the rape “never happened.” Her admission came after DNA testing connected the semen found on her body to another man through an F.B.I. database. “At the end of the day  nothing will give these men back the years away from family  or the years spent in prison ” Mr. Vance said. “No apology can make them whole.” The exonerations were the result of a collaborative investigation started in 2017 by the Manhattan district attorney’s Conviction Integrity Program  the Innocence Project and the Office of the Appellate Defender’s Reinvestigation Project. The three entities filed a joint motion on Monday asking Justice Mark Dwyer to vacate the convictions and dismiss the original indictments. “This was a particularly dark time in New York City during the crack epidemic ” said Barry Scheck  co-founder of the Innocence Project  a nonprofit that uses DNA evidence to exonerate wrongly convicted prisoners. “At this point in time in New York City  people were scared of teenagers who looked like my clients.” None Lawyers for Mr. Perry and Mr. Counts said the case was flawed from the start. When the trial began in 1992  the woman testified that she lived in a house in Queens with her boyfriend  who was a recovering addict  and their two children. Mr. Perry was dating a teenage girl who lived in the same house  and he eventually moved in  according to court records. The woman’s boyfriend began using drugs again and selling them from her home along with Mr. Perry  Mr. Counts and a third man. But in September 1990  the men assaulted the boyfriend for failing to pay back a debt. Two months later  she said  her home was burglarized and she told the police she believed it was the three men. Sometime after that incident  the woman testified that Mr. Perry confronted her boyfriend at their home and that he shot Mr. Perry. She told a jury that on Jan. 18  1991  she was leaving her home in Queens when Mr. Counts  Mr. Perry and a third man forced her into a car at knife point and demanded to know where her boyfriend was. When she refused to tell them where he was  she testified that they drove around and raped her multiple times in the vehicle and in Central Park. During the trial  the defense argued that she was not a reliable witness  and that her stories shifted often. The defense also argued that the woman had a motive to retaliate against the men and to help her boyfriend avoid charges that he had shot Mr. Perry. Mr. Counts and Mr. Perry spent years fighting their convictions despite a number of failed appeals. None “He never gave up ” she said. In 2012  attorneys with the Innocence Project contacted the district attorney’s office requesting physical evidence in the case. In 2015  the DNA was retested. It matched the profile of a man who had been about 40 years old in 1991 and died in 2011  according to court records. Investigators with the prosecutor’s office interviewed the woman in 2016 with a photo of the person who may have been the attacker  but the woman told them she did not recognize him. She explained to investigators that she had used drugs at that time and that she would sell herself to support her habit. She refused to talk further. In February  investigators found and interviewed the third man  who denied the rape and explained that the car in which the woman said she was attacked was not running at the time  court records show. Investigators returned to the woman  who this time admitted that the story was a lie. She told investigators that her boyfriend forced her to make the fake accusations and that she had been haunted by what she had done. After his release  Mr. Perry moved to Portland  Ore.  married and had six children. He struggled with the label of “sex offender ” but found work building houses and cars  and started a landscaping business to support his family. “He didn’t want to go back to the place where he had been treated so unfairly ” said Mandy Jaramillo  senior staff lawyer with the Office of the Appellate Defender. He returned to New York City for the first time on Monday. Since his release  Mr. Counts has struggled to find a job — many employers were put off by his record — but he said he has the support of his family. “This case is a tragedy for everyone involved ” Mr. Vance said in an interview. “It is every district attorney’s nightmare that any innocent man or woman would go to jail.” None None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,assault
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/26/world/europe/spain-pamplona-gang-rape-verdict.html,Verdict in Pamplona Gang Rape Case Sets Off Immediate Outcry Advertisement Supported by None MADRID — In a case that was seen as a bellwether for women’s rights in Spain  a court on Thursday sentenced five men for sexually abusing a woman during the bull-running festival of Pamplona  but cleared them of raping her  to the dismay of women’s associations. Shortly after the verdict  various women’s groups announced that they would lead protests on Thursday evening across Spain to condemn the ruling. The five men were sentenced to nine years in prison for “continuous sexual abuse ” rather than the almost 23 years in prison that the prosecution had sought for rape and other charges. The woman’s lawyer said she would appeal the ruling. The government of Navarre  the region of Pamplona where the case was heard  said it would back the appeal. The case could go as far as the Spanish Supreme Court. The attack took place in July 2016  during the festivities in Pamplona that have turned into one of Spain’s main tourism attractions  when visitors flock to the city to watch people try to dodge bulls hurtling down narrow streets on their way to the ring. None The court on Thursday found the five young men  who are from Seville  guilty of “sexual abuse” of the woman  but cleared them of the more serious charge of rape  which must involve violence or intimidation under Spanish law. On top of their prison sentence  the men were ordered to pay a combined 50 000 euros ($60 600) in compensation to the woman. One of the defendants  who was a military police officer at the time  was also fined €900 for stealing her cellphone. The five men used to refer to their own gang as the “manada ” a term commonly used to refer to a pack of wolves  a description that in itself became a symbol for feminist associations of the aggressive machismo that women suffer in Spain. Following their detention  the men’s lawyers argued that the woman was not gang raped but had consented to unprotected sex. Part of their claim was based on the phone video footage  which showed her to have been still  with her eyes shut during the assault. The lawyers also argued that  after meeting the men  the woman had agreed to be escorted by them to her car and had allowed one of the men to kiss her. The prosecution  however  argued that any initial friendliness turned to terror once she was taken instead by the men into an out-of-sight alcove and attacked there  leaving her too frightened to fight back or even move while being raped. The attack was one of several assaults reported during the bull-running festival in 2016  even though the city had organized a special information campaign to help prevent sex crimes. The police presence had also been stepped up and high-definition surveillance cameras deployed across the city. Thursday’s verdict followed a long trial that had already set off significant controversy after lawyers for the five men started to portray the victim as a consenting sexual partner who suffered no lasting damage. The defendants’ lawyers also used a private detective to follow the woman and gather evidence that she returned to a normal life after the assault  but part of that evidence was eventually withdrawn by the judges. Instead  the woman said that she was undergoing long-term therapy to help her overcome the trauma of the sexual assault. Following Thursday’s ruling  Soledad Murillo  a former state secretary for gender equality  called for an overhaul of Spain’s criminal code. The ruling  she said  left the impression that “these guys went a bit too far but didn’t want to hurt.” None The official spokesman of the Basque regional government  Josu Erkoreka  warned that the ruling would give legitimacy to machismo violence and would not be understood “by the society of the 21st century.” Different police associations also condemned the ruling  posting “No is No” messages on social media — one of the slogans that was already widely used in the protests held in 2016 after the attack in Pamplona. Public interest in the outcome of the Pamplona trial also rose following the launch of the #MeToo and Time’s Up campaigns to fight sexual harassment in Hollywood and beyond.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/11/world/asia/nepal-peter-dalglish-aid-pedophilia.html,Noted Humanitarian Charged With Child Rape in Nepal  Stunning a Village Advertisement Supported by None KARTIKE  Nepal — When Peter Dalglish  a lauded humanitarian worker  built a sleek cabin near a Nepalese village of rutted roads and hills ribbed with rice paddies  locals knew virtually nothing about him. None The good will was shattered last month when the police swarmed around Mr. Dalglish’s home  placed a gun to his head and arrested him on charges of raping at least two boys  12 and 14. Suddenly  villagers were on edge  worried about how far the betrayal — and abuse — may have stretched. “We trusted him ” said Sher Bahadur Tamang  who said he received hundreds of dollars from Mr. Dalglish to pay for his child’s education. “He treated us so well. We never knew what was inside his mind.” Mr. Dalglish’s downfall has been a shock partly because his work aiding street children around the world was so widely admired. In 2016  he was awarded the Order of Canada  one of the country’s highest civilian honors. None None None None None None None Earlier this month  Mr. Dalglish was charged with pedophilia in a district court. He faces up to 13 years in prison. “He sexually abused children after giving them the false hope that they would be taken to a foreign country ” said Jeevan Shrestha  a spokesman for Nepal’s Chief Investigation Bureau. None None None But in Nepal  where he has lived off-and-on since 2002  some of those who knew him recalled unsettling requests. In Kathmandu  Nepal’s capital  at a school which provides free education to children from mountain communities  Mr. Dalglish was a popular volunteer in the early 2000s until he asked administrators to change a rule barring students from staying overnight with teachers. Soon after  the relationship between the school’s staff members and Mr. Dalglish soured  a senior administrator said  and he was banned from the campus. None “But obviously  if you do the work that I do  with kids  you leave yourself open to criticism and suspicion ” he said. Mr. Dalglish declined further interview requests. Rahul Chapagain  Mr. Dalglish’s lawyer  said that evidence collected by the police could belong to visitors who rented the home through Airbnb. “Whatever they found  it does not necessarily belong to Peter ” he said. None On a recent day  the home was empty and locked  a ruffled comforter on the couch and board games tucked into an armoire visible through the windows. Around Kartike (pronounced kar-ti-kay)  a sleepy village where farmers wield sickles in watery fields  many expressed horror that a possible predator had been living just up the hill. At a restaurant in town  the father of one of the boys in the case said he had worked as a laborer on Mr. Dalglish’s property for half a decade and had formed a warm bond with his boss. The father  Mr. Tamang  identifying himself only by his common last name to protect his family’s privacy  said he let his son  14  occasionally spend the night at Mr. Dalglish’s home. On the morning of April 7  Mr. Tamang was jolted awake by nearly a dozen police officers  who escorted him up a snaking path of slate-colored tiles to Mr. Dalglish’s home  where his son was sleeping. Inside the house  Mr. Dalglish spoke calmly to the police in English  a language Mr. Tamang did not understand. Later  Mr. Tamang learned that plainclothes police officers had befriended his son  who told the authorities that he  his 12-year-old cousin and at least two other boys had been abused by Mr. Dalglish. In an interview  Mr. Tamang’s son said Mr. Dalglish had sexually assaulted him over a period of seven years  promising him a better life abroad if he kept quiet. “I think the police were following Peter for a long time ” Mr. Tamang said. “The boys said they were asked to sleep naked and were raped.” Until the boys stepped forward  villagers said there had been no signs of improper behavior by Mr. Dalglish. He treated those who worked for him well and bought clothing  shoes and pencils for children in the village. It is unclear who initially tipped off the police about Mr. Dalglish. A few days after the arrest  Mr. Tamang said he was summoned by the authorities to Mr. Dalglish’s home. The police showed him a small  white box. Inside were dozens of photographs and film negatives of naked children  some of them playing in pools  Mr. Tamang said. Mr. Chapagain  the lawyer  said Mr. Dalglish told him they were “pictures of poverty-stricken children and nothing sexually exploitative.” But Mr. Tamang was unconvinced  characterizing the experience as a nightmarish episode in his family’s ordeal. “I never imagined Peter would do such a thing ” he said.

Warns of Imminent Births Advertisement Supported by None COX'S BAZAR  Bangladesh — With her 16-day old son lying asleep in her lap  tears streamed down the face of a 20-year-old Rohingya refugee in Bangladesh as she accused Myanmar troops of covering her eyes and mouth and raping her  before making her watch as they killed her husband.  ""I don't know if this baby is from my husband or the rape "" said the woman  speaking through a translator  during a visit by United Nations Security Council envoys to camps in Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh sheltering nearly a million refugees.  Ahead of the council visit to Bangladesh and Myanmar last week  senior U.N. officials warned the envoys about the prospect of a flood of babies being born in the coming weeks and months in the refugee camps that could be the result of rape.  In a joint statement  U.N. envoy for sexual violence in conflict  Pramila Patten  and U.N. assistant secretary-general for human rights Andrew Gilmour wrote ""reports suggest Rohingya women and girls were raped on a systematic and possibly massive scale."" ""Many of the women and girls raped in 2017 are due to give birth in the next few weeks  during the monsoon season  and we are concerned that many will not be able to access medical care to give birth safely "" they wrote.  Nearly 700 000 mainly Rohingya Muslims fled to Bangladesh in the past eight months following a Myanmar military crackdown that the United Nations  United States and Britain have denounced as ethnic cleansing. Myanmar denies ethnic cleansing. In March the United Nations launched an appeal for $951 million to help the Rohingya refugees for the rest of the year  but the world body said at the end of April it was only 9.0 percent funded. The United Nations and aid groups working in the refugee camps in Cox's Bazar  Bangladesh  said that it was difficult to know exactly how many women and girls were pregnant. It was even more difficult to know how many of the pregnancies were the result of rape. ""With the help of the U.N. bodies and other international and national (aid groups)  we are trying to identify the pregnant women so that they get proper treatment "" said a senior Bangladesh health ministry official  who declined to be named due to sensitivity of the matter. He said that so far 18 300 pregnant women had been identified and the rough total estimate was around 25 000. Rohingya insurgent attacks on security posts in Myanmar's Rakhine state in August sparked a military operation that Myanmar described as a legitimate response. Fleeing refugees have reported killings  rapes and arson on a large scale. ""Based on U.N. reports and testimonies from Rohingya women who told our staff of rape and sexual violence in Myanmar  we do sadly expect the number of babies born as a result of unwarranted pregnancies to increase in the coming months "" said Daphnee Cook  Save the Children's spokeswoman in Cox's Bazar. MYANMAR MILITARY BLACKLISTED U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres recently blacklisted the Myanmar armed forces in his annual report on conflict-related sexual violence. The military must now decide whether to work with Patten on a plan that would lead to their removal from the blacklist. During a two hour meeting with Security Council envoys in Myanmar's capital Naypyitaw last week  military chief Min Aung Hlaing vowed ""harsh action"" over sexual violence. According to the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper  he said: ""Sexual violence (is) considered as despicable acts."" Last November  Myanmar's military release a report denying all accusations of rape by security forces.  Melissa How  Médecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) Medical Coordinator in Cox's Bazar  said the had seen ""a number of women and girls"" who had become pregnant from sexual violence in Myanmar or Bangladesh.  ""Some have miscarried  some have turned to traditional medicine and other methods to end their pregnancies  using unsafe methods. A number of women and girls have chosen to access MSF facilities for medical care  as well as menstrual regulation  in Bangladesh "" she said.  Abortion is illegal in Bangladesh but menstrual regulation to terminate a pregnancy is permissible. How also added that the majority of women in the camps who give birth do so outside health facilities. Myanmar and Bangladesh agreed in January to complete the voluntary repatriation of the refugees within two years but the deal poses a challenge for women who give birth to children born from cases of rape.  U.N. envoy Patten  who will visit Cox's Bazar this month  said a complying with a requirement in the deal for women to go the Bangladesh Supreme Court to obtain a document noting that a child had been ""born out of unwarranted incidence "" a reference to cases of rape resulting in pregnancy  may be too difficult for poor  illiterate women.

The attack came shortly before Burundians vote May 17 in a controversial referendum that could extend the president's term. It was not immediately clear if the attack was related  although some activists said they believe it was. Speaking at the scene  Security Minister Alain Guillaume Bunyoni told reporters that 24 people were killed in their homes Friday night and two others died of their wounds at a local hospital. He gave no further details about the attack in Ruhagarika community in the northwestern province of Cibitoke. One survivor told The Associated Press the attackers came around 10 p.m. and ""attacked households and set fire on houses."" Some victims were hacked with machetes and others were shot or burned alive  she said. Her husband and two children were killed  she said. She spoke on condition of anonymity  citing safety concerns. ""These killers attacked my family and I am very angry "" said another survivor  Pascal Hakizimana. ""My family is dead and to make matters worse  the army did nothing to save them even when they were not far from here."" A police officer  who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to a reporter  said four of the families targeted were headed by people he called ""police agents."" ""(The attackers) said when leaving  'Where are those you trust to rescue you?"" he said. Activists expressed concern. ""This is extra-judiciary killings. What one can ask is this: Do we have to see innocent people killed whenever elections are near in Burundi?"" said Gerard Hakizimana  leader of a pro-democracy civic group known as Folucon F. President Pierre Nkuruniza  on Twitter  urged unity in the East African nation and said those who carried out the attack would be pursued and punished. Burundi has seen deadly political violence since early 2015 when Nkurunziza successfully pursued a disputed third term. He later survived a coup attempt led by senior army and police officers  including some who fled and announced they had launched a rebel group against the government. An estimated 1 200 people  including ruling party supporters  have died in sporadic violence since April 2015  according to the United Nations  with most of the killings blamed on the authorities and their allies. Now Burundians are being asked to vote on a proposal to extend the president's term from five years to seven  which would allow Nkurunziza to rule for another 14 years when his current term expires in 2020. Campaigns ahead of the referendum have been marred by hate speech  with one ruling party official sent to prison after he called for those who oppose the referendum to be drowned. The United States earlier this month denounced ""violence  intimidation  and harassment"" against those thought to oppose the referendum and expressed concern about the ""non-transparent process"" of changing the constitution. Human Rights Watch has noted ""widespread impunity"" for authorities and their allies  including the ruling party's youth wing  as they try to swing the vote in the president's favor. Many in Burundi  a poor country that still relies heavily on foreign aid  worry that a new round of bloodshed will follow the referendum no matter its results. Already more than 400 000 people have fled the country since April 2015  according to the U.N. Nkurunziza  a former rebel leader  rose to power in 2005 following the end of Burundi's civil war that killed about 300 000 people. He was re-elected unopposed in 2010 after the opposition boycotted. He said he was eligible for a third term in 2015 because lawmakers  not the general population  chose him for his first term. ___ Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ",assault

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the death toll from attacks early Thursday has risen from 23 to 27  including at least 11 Iranians and six Syrian soldiers  including three officers. In total  42 people  including 19 Iranians  were killed over two days of strikes — from Tuesday to Thursday — according to the Observatory. The escalation between Israel and Iran has raised fears the region may be sliding into an unprecedented direct confrontation between the two archenemies. Israel's defense minister called on Syria's President Bashar Assad on Friday to clear his country of Iranian forces based there — warning that their presence will only bring more trouble to the already war-ravaged country. Avigdor Lieberman's comments were followed by threats from an Iranian cleric that Tel Aviv or Haifa would be in danger if Israel did ""anything foolish."" Israel had said its strikes on Thursday were in response to a barrage of Iranian rockets on its positions in the occupied Golan Heights  the most serious military confrontation between the two bitter enemies to date. It said it hit targets near the capital  in southern and central Syria  targeting weapons storage  logistics sites and intelligence centers used by elite Iranian forces in Syria. It also said it destroyed several Syrian air-defense systems after coming under heavy fire and that none of its warplanes were hit. Syrian state-run media had said that Israel struck a military outpost near the capital Damascus late Tuesday  adding that its air defenses intercepted and destroyed two of the incoming missiles. The Observatory said at least 15 were killed in the strike  eight of them Iranians  including a member of the Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards. Israel had previously warned that Iran has been deploying its allied militias in the area. Iran says Israel's repeated attacks are based on ""fabricated"" reasons. Separately  the Syrian state-run al-Ikhariya TV and the Observatory said airstrikes Saturday hit civilians in an Islamic State-controlled village in the northern Hassakeh province. The Observatory said eight members of the same family  including three children and five women  were killed. Al-Ikhbariya put the death toll from the strikes at nine  including four children. State-run TV said they were carried out by the U.S-led coalition  which is operating in the area against IS. An airstrike in the same area earlier this month killed at least 23 civilians.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/11/arts/music/review-lessons-love-violence-george-benjamin.html,Review: A Long-Awaited New Opera Is a Raucous Beauty Advertisement Supported by None LONDON — George Benjamin and Martin Crimp have done it again. None None Recalling the gnomic character names in “Written on Skin ” Edward is referred to only as the King (the charismatic baritone Stéphane Degout)  his heir is the Boy (the tenor Samuel Boden)  Edward’s wife  Queen Isabella  is Isabel (the expressive and riveting soprano Barbara Hannigan). The opera opens in the King’s apartment  with him and Gaveston (the robust baritone Gyula Orendt) brazenly flaunting their affair  even as a military adviser  Mortimer (the bright-voiced tenor Peter Hoare)  argues that love — any love — is “poison” to both the human body and the body politic. A gaggle of nonspeaking actors with notepads mills about like obsequious officials or timid modern-day reporters  a powerless public hanging on every interaction of the royal family and the King’s enemies. Isabel  who wants to maintain her position  at first thinks she has no choice but to accommodate her husband’s involvement with Gaveston. But is the courtier engaged in a calculating power move? Has the King chosen him as a way of defiantly asserting his right to indulge in the luxuries of love and culture  even as his realm is wracked with famine and civil unrest? At one point we see the King and Gaveston entwined in a romantic embrace just before an audience arrives to see a play. Their insinuating  sensual lines unfold together  but the musical effect is not exactly contrapuntal: the two voices sound almost codependent. You think Isabel is going to be the most sympathetic character in the opera. But not long after the start  we see her dark side as she’s startlingly impervious to a group of starving citizens  witnesses to the deprivation and strife spreading throughout the land. One woman  hinting bitterly at the King’s affair with Gaveston  asks a chilling question: “They say we know why the poor sleep three in a bed  but why do the rich?” The story begins to move toward its bloody conclusion as Isabel realizes the King has gone too far and she has to ally with Mortimer and acquiesce to Gaveston’s capture — and  eventually  his death. With Gaveston gone  the King renounces his wife  leaving himself precariously isolated. None Ms. Mitchell and the designer Vicki Mortimer have made the opera’s various scenes — the King’s apartment  Isabel’s chambers  a theater  a prison — different vantage points on the same well-appointed room  with a large fish tank  a display case full of busts and a Francis Bacon-esque portrait. But it’s Mr. Benjamin’s remarkable music that gives the work its charge: The writing is so lush  haunting and detailed — radiant one moment  piercingly dissonant the next — that you are continuously enveloped by the raucous beauty of the sounds. As the opening scene begins  needling brass riffs protrude over sputtering clusters of hard-edged chords. Sometimes a bed of strings will swell with a prolonged sonority  though the component notes are too restless to stay put. Instrumental lines emerge from atmospheric murmurs  trying to coalesce into melodic fragments. Mr. Crimp’s text  as in “Written on Skin ” is enigmatic. “You know where I am: inside your life ” Gaveston tells the King. Early on  the King warns Mortimer  who is clearly drawn to the queen  that wherever Mortimer touches the “immaculate surface” of Isabel’s skin  “your politics will leave streaks of my blood.” Mr. Benjamin savors the strangeness of these words. He was determined  he says in an interview in the program book  to set the text so that it would be audible. He does so impressively  aided by the crisp diction of the singers  often by following the natural rhythms of speech. But he knows when to allow a vocal line to turn mellifluous. For all the hypnotic allure of the opera  I kept waiting for the music to clobber me. That finally happened  twice  toward the end. With the King dethroned and arrested  Mortimer has set up house with Isabel  grooming the Boy to become the next king. The Boy is taught his first lesson in leadership — really a lesson in the futility of love and the utility of violence: A madman has appeared claiming to be the king  and Mortimer tries to force the boy to punish him. When the Boy proves too weak  the man is killed in his presence  as the orchestra erupts in gnashing rage. In the next scene  Mr. Orendt reappears as a Stranger — a figure of death — to claim the King in one last embrace. Then  in an orchestral transition  comes that second burst of vehemence. I won’t give away the opera’s resolution  other than to say that the Boy  now king  has learned his lessons all too well.

Yes  violence. A disease is a condition with identifiable symptoms that causes sickness or death. That describes violence. None Dr. Slutkin’s work taught him that to control an epidemic  people must abandon practices that spread disease. Changing community norms is a far more effective method than simply giving people information. “The best predictor of condom use is whether people think their friends use condoms ” he said. That’s why trusted community members with some training are so effective. “Outsiders can guide and train and provide people with skills ” said Dr. Slutkin. “But all epidemics are always worked from the inside out.” None Cure Violence didn’t invent the idea of street work to reduce crime  Chicago was using it in the 1940s  according to Andrew Papachristos  a prominent scholar of gun violence who now teaches at Northwestern. “But Cure Violence took it to another level ” Professor Papachristos said. “It professionalized street work and put it into public health.” Demeatreas Whatley is 46 and a part-time college student who ultimately wants to get a doctorate in public health. He also works for Cure Violence at one of its 10 Chicago sites — a new storefront office in the Grand Crossing neighborhood on Chicago’s South Side  one of the city’s most violent places. When Mr. Whatley got out of prison in 2008  after serving 17 years for aggravated discharge of a firearm  one of the first things he did was to volunteer for Cure Violence. “I wanted my block safe ” he said. The use of a gun to settle even petty disputes is not at all the norm in poor communities of color. It is the norm among a very small group of individuals — mostly young  mostly men. For this group  people like Mr. Whatley are the most credible messengers. For nine years he worked as a “violence interrupter ” which meant detecting imminent violence  talking people out of shooting and mediating the kind of disputes that often lead to chains of retaliatory shootings. I asked Mr. Whatley to describe an intervention. “Say there’s a fight ” he said. “The guy who loses goes to get a gun. You’ve got to calm him down and let him save face. I tell him: ‘I lost plenty of fights. At the end of the day  you’re a stand-up guy because you fought. It’s the coward who goes to get the gun.’” Mr. Whatley said people forget about consequences in a heated moment  especially if friends are egging them on. So he reminds them. “If you shoot this guy  you’ll be the prime suspect ” he would say. “Do you want to lose at least eight years of your life because you lost a fight? Why don’t you leave it to us?” And he and his colleagues would then find someone trusted by the other party  who could persuade the man to drop the beef and stay away. A few months ago  Mr. Whatley began supervising Cure Violence’s new site in Grand Crossing. His group has 11 violence interrupters and four outreach workers. The outreach workers’ job is to get the clients help  from finding a slot in drug or alcohol rehab to helping a client pack up and move in the middle of the night. All 15 staff members are from the neighborhood. Many said they had been doing this work informally before they were hired. “There’s a sense of urgency to right your wrongs ” said Jessie Davis  a violence interrupter. None Every Tuesday afternoon  the Grand Crossing staff meets to review the past week. In late April  Mr. Whatley sat at the front of the room with his laptop  on which he tracks the group’s work. The staff members  all wearing black Cure Violence hoodies or orange windbreakers  went over the week’s incidents of violence  discussed particularly hot corners or blocks and described mediations they had conducted. One interrupter said that a fight had erupted over a video posted on social media  a huge generator of beefs. The interrupter persuaded the post’s originator to agree to take down the video  and got the person who felt disrespected to leave it at that. “Good work ” Mr. Whatley told the group. “We’re going to close out April pretty strong.” The staff had conducted 18 mediations — double the number in March. In the past month there was not a single gang-related homicide in the Cure Violence site’s territory  he announced. Shootings are an after-school and nighttime activity  so that’s when the staff members go out on the beat. They go in groups of five to seven people for safety. After the meeting  one group drove a few blocks and parked in the lot of a Foodtown grocery store. They stood on the sidewalk  up against a chain-link fence. The location was strategic  just down the block from two schools about to let children out for the day. The staff gave out postcards with messages seeking an end to violence. Four young men who are clients of the program wandered over  and the staff invited them to a monthly cookout the group was holding on the weekend. They traded stories about their children. An outreach worker told them about a job-training program at Chicago’s power company. A middle-aged man pulled into the parking lot and got out of his car. When he was young  he had been involved in violence. Now the man is a key source of intelligence for Cure Violence  said an outreach worker named Chrisse. “He helps us stay on top of things ” Chrisse said. “He gives me a heads-up if it’s clear or there are guys lying in wait. I’ll get a text: ‘Not a good day  Chrisse.’” Cure Violence is working in a dozen cities in Latin America  and several in Africa and the Middle East. Iraqis are using the model to defuse sectarian conflicts  and Moroccans to try to reduce violent extremism. None None Cure Violence operates in 21 United States cities  but it will always be most linked to its hometown  Chicago  which  sadly  in recent years has been America’s murder capital. The city’s homicide rate has swung wildly: In 2003  homicides dropped by 25 percent. Between 2014 and 2016  they rose by 87 percent. And last year  they abruptly dropped again. None None None None None “The evaluations are positive but at times still mixed ” said Professor Papachristos. “But to think it’s going to work with every gang and every neighborhood is Polyanna-ish.

The shudders begin soon after the movie does when a woman opens a door  stares into the camera and falls to the ground. Just one look  and Dafna (Sarah Adler) knows the worst: The soldiers on her doorstep have come bringing death. Her son  Jonathan (Yonatan Shiray)  who’s in the army  has been killed. In a whir of motion and fatigue green  they stoop over Dafna  soothing and sedating her  then tucking her in bed. Her husband  Michael (a fantastic Lior Ashkenazi)  mutely stares at this scene as if he were a bystander in his own life. It’s a grabber of an opening in a movie that builds into a devastating indictment of a nation  shock by shock  brutal moment by brutal moment. (The movie is Israel’s Oscar entry in the foreign-language category.) Meaning surfaces slowly here in details  flashes of cruelty  glimmers of apathy and a mounting sense of helplessness. First  though  there are parental tears and Dafna and Michael’s handsome  sparsely furnished apartment with its tidy bookshelves and modernist furniture. The biggest room  where Michael lingers while watching Dafna collapse  has a geometrically patterned floor and is so large and precisely arranged that it suggests a showroom. At times  it also evokes a stage. With Dafna asleep in the bedroom  Michael initially suffers and mourns alone. His red eyes watering yet not quite spilling over  he understandably seems to be in shock. The soldiers have tended to him  too  fussing and hovering over him  in one shot  he looks up at them as if he were a child. His brother (Yehuda Almagor)  comes by and begins busily arranging a memorial notice. Two women rush in as well  including Michael and Dafna’s daughter (Shira Haas). Everyone plays his or her part. The soldiers re-enter  and one comfortably settles into a chair and rather too blithely proposes funeral arrangements to Michael  sketching in every detail with the fastidious attention of a wedding planner. None None After the intense emotions and physical limitations of the apartment  the checkpoint with its wide-open vistas provides relief. For a moment  if seems as if you can breathe. The soldiers are cute  amusing and very young. They’ve settled into dull  monotonous work — raising the barrier for a camel — that can seem absurd. (What could go wrong?) But they also dance  draw  listen to music  tell stories and entertain one another. The looseness and humor of their interactions are welcome  but there are also new shivers of unease: The soldiers bunk in what looks like a repurposed  derelict shipping container. Everything is falling apart  decaying  and the container is rapidly sinking into the mud. If that sounds like a metaphor  it most likely is. Mr. Maoz doesn’t say  at least through the dialogue. Avoiding speeches and exegesis  he writes characters that talk like ordinary people in everyday life  even as he focuses your attention on their faces  their interactions with others  how they carry themselves  how they withdraw and advance. (You learn more about Michael from how he treats the family dog than from what he says.) Visually  though  Mr. Maoz leans into Expressionism. Michael and Dafna’s apartment  for instance  creates a powerful sense of a purposefully ordered world that is upended by grief  the abject decay surrounding Jonathan says something else entirely. It’s no surprise when violence fully erupts at the checkpoint. It’s been hanging over this movie much as those carefully doting soldiers hovered over Michael and Dafna  telling them  wrongly of course  that their only son had died serving his country. Those soldiers are so good at what they do  Mr. Maoz suggests  because they have so much experience. There’s even a sense  conveyed through their practiced calm and soothing voices  that violence and grief are somehow inevitable  maybe normal. Image by image  and with invocations of history and the Holocaust  Mr. Moaz also suggests that normalizing catastrophic violence — and routinizing mourning — is finally little else than nihilism.

Subtlety gives way to blunter characterizations when the two main advocates spar in the courtroom. Katja’s interests are represented by an old friend (Denis Moschitto)  who seems kind and conscientious. The accused murderers  a young married couple  are defended by a tall  bald  sarcastic lawyer (Johannes Krisch) who is perhaps a bit too transparently villainous. But he does succeed in galvanizing the audience’s disgust  and in reframing the story as a conflict between the desire for justice and the drive for vengeance. This is a venerable theme in movies  driving the plots of most of westerns. In this instance  it carries an extra jolt of political relevance. How should liberal societies deal with homegrown political extremists  who seek protection from the democratic norms and institutions they are committed to destroying? How should the victims of far-right-wing violence fight back? That last question brings about a startling change of scene and tone in the movie’s final section  which feels like a miniature film noir set in the incongruous sunshine of Greece. But just as “In the Fade” should be reaching its starkest  sharpest point  as Katja’s pain pushes her toward a moral crisis  Mr. Akin’s focus seems to waver  and the sense of tough existential clarity that is his greatest virtue goes blurry. The ending is puzzling  when it wants to be devastating  and the political and personal sides of the story  rather than illuminating each other  fight to a stalemate. Ms. Kruger  however  who won the best actress award at Cannes in May  leaves a vivid  haunting impression. Katja  who has already traveled a path from wildness to domestic stability  struggles with the enforced passivity of violent bereavement. With her husband and son gone  the world is dislodged from its axis  and there is nothing Katja can do to set it right again. Dwelling in her sorrow is agonizing  but moving on might be even worse.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/25/books/review-beneath-ruthless-sun-gilbert-king.html,A True-Crime Mystery From the 1950s  Fueled by Racism and Corruption Advertisement Supported by Books of The Times None None In “Beneath a Ruthless Sun: A True Story of Violence  Race  and Justice Lost and Found ” Gilbert King recounts how the sheriff descended on the cabin rendezvous of two interracial couples in 1956 and arrested them for violating Florida’s anti-miscegenation statute — but not before trying to enlist his deputies to help him throw the black men “to the alligators” and daring one of the men to run. (“I want to get in some target practice ” McCall said.) The F.B.I. investigated  and then withdrew. McCall was re-elected to his fourth term as sheriff  celebrated by those who praised him for what one supporter called his “efficiency and untiring efforts” in punishing “the ravages of Negroes upon white women and girls.” This isn’t the main incident in the book  but it’s a telling one  if only because it reflects the many convolutions King pursues. As the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning “Devil in the Grove” (2012) and “The Execution of Willie Francis” (2008)  King has written about racism and spectacular miscarriages of justice before. McCall was a central figure in “Devil in the Grove ” having participated in the zealous prosecution of four black men wrongly convicted of raping a 17-year-old white woman in 1949. After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the convictions of two of the so-called Groveland Four  McCall shot the men  killing one of them. At first glance  King’s new book looks like it will recount another one of McCall’s fervid campaigns to incarcerate a black man for a crime he didn’t necessarily commit. “Beneath a Ruthless Sun” begins in December 1957  when Blanche Bosanquet Knowles  the wife of a Lake County citrus baron  reported a rape. Her husband was out of town and she was at home  alone with their three children  when  she said  a “husky Negro” with “bushy hair” attacked her in the middle of the night. McCall told his deputies to round up every black man they could find. A week and a half later  McCall and the state attorney  Gordon Oldham  announced they had found the rapist and were holding him in custody. The alleged culprit? Jesse Delbert Daniels  an impoverished  mentally impaired 19-year-old with a fifth-grade education. Daniels was also white. Oldham explained that the house was so dark at the time of the rape that Knowles had misidentified her assailant’s skin color. Was this a case in which justice was actually served? Or was something more confounding — and insidious — at work? McCall had held two black men in custody for several days  Knowles stated that a black man attacked her  and now McCall  who once declared that black men had a “barbarous animal instinct” that “a white man don’t have ” was suddenly saying a white man did it. As a local journalist named Mabel Norris Reese put it at the time  this was a puzzling turn from an office “that gloats over the ‘crime record’ of Negroes.” If McCall is the villain of King’s book  Reese is clearly the hero  doggedly trying to find out what happened to Blanche Knowles while teaming up with Daniels’s mother  Pearl  to advocate on his behalf. At a hearing that lasted barely five minutes  Truman G. Futch — the same judge from the Groveland case — deemed Daniels “insane and incompetent ” and had him committed to the Florida State Hospital at Chattahoochee without a trial. Daniels  who still slept with a teddy bear  would spend the next 14 years there  confined to the criminal ward. Reese got ensnared in a tangled web of promising leads and dead ends — as does King’s book  which can get bogged down in the morass of Lake County’s unrelenting racism and squalid corruption. A chapter on Chattahoochee meanders away from the Daniels case and into varieties of shock therapy  ice pick lobotomies  Rosemary Kennedy and unwritten “paramour rights.” Another chapter is devoted to the plight of the Platt family  whose five children were expelled from a Lake County public school in 1954 on suspicion of being black (even though the Platts identified as Irish-Indian and had government documentation stating they were white). McCall insisted on inspecting the children himself  pointing to the 13-year-old daughter and saying  “I don’t like the shape of that one’s nose.” None But where “Devil in the Grove” pitted McCall’s viciousness against the rich and complicated character of Thurgood Marshall  the future Supreme Court justice who defended the Groveland Four  “Beneath a Ruthless Sun” tracks the noble efforts of Reese  who is mainly presented here through her earnest editorials. No doubt Reese was not as one-dimensional as the upstanding figure in this book (in the Groveland case  King mentions  she had initially called for the execution of the defendants). But without a more riveting linchpin to anchor the narrative  “Beneath a Ruthless Sun” grows as sprawling as the conspiracy it depicts. Which ultimately might illustrate King’s point. The plot against Daniels seems baffling  verging on nonsensical — until you begin to see the community the way King does: so deformed by racial animus and misogyny that the white establishment of Lake County deemed it less of an “indignity” for Knowles to have been raped by a white man than a black man. To disclose too many details would be to spoil the book  since much of its momentum relies on the true crime at the center of it  and the mystery of how the many bewildering bits of information might all fit together. The racism and corruption King depicts were so embedded in Lake County that they perverted even perversions of justice  the argument is timely and important  even if one sometimes wishes it were more clearly made.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/nyregion/consent-sexual-assault-rough-sex.html,Eric Schneiderman  Consent and Domestic Violence Advertisement Supported by None When four women accused Eric T. Schneiderman  the New York attorney general  of physical assault this week  he suggested that they were describing consensual sexual encounters. The allegations against him were new. That defense was not. Those accused of committing violence against their partners often seek to dismiss those claims  sometimes by arguing that the partners were willing participants in sexual role playing or “rough sex.” Here’s a look at the legal and other issues raised by such claims. None “In the privacy of intimate relationships  I have engaged in role-playing and other consensual sexual activity ” he wrote. “I have not assaulted anyone. I have never engaged in nonconsensual sex  which is a line I would not cross.” Many men before him have said the same when confronted by such accusations. In 2014  for example  several women accused Jian Ghomeshi  a well-known Canadian musician and former radio host  of biting  punching  choking and smothering. None There is a bright line between pain caused by unwanted sexual or domestic violence and pain that can come during some kinds of consensual sexual activity among willing participants. “If it’s not consensual  then it’s not ‘rough sex.’ It’s abuse ” said Susan Wright  the founder of the National Coalition for Sexual Freedom  an advocacy organization for a diverse range of sexualities and sexual preferences. Consent should be given early and often  she said. Limits  risks and how to stop sexual activity should be discussed beforehand. And assumptions should never be made. “I know some people think it’s not sexy or spontaneous to actually talk about sex before you have it ” she said. “They’re absolutely wrong  because it’s the best foreplay in the world to talk about the things that turn you on and find out what things turn the other person on.” Even with consent  if sexual activity causes serious harm  it crosses the line to assault  she said. In seeking to explain away their crimes  violent perpetrators have long claimed that victims “asked for it.” None The trial revolved around the death by strangling of Jennifer Dawn Levin in the summer of 1986. The night before a bicyclist found her body behind the Metropolitan Museum of Art  Ms. Levin had met up with Robert E. Chambers Jr. at Dorrian’s Red Hand  a bar on the Upper East Side. The pair left the bar together at about 4:30 a.m. before walking to Central Park. None The New York Daily News highlighted his defense in the front-page headline the following day: “Girl’s slaying suspect: SEX PLAY ‘GOT ROUGH.’” The trial turned into a media sensation. In the end  Mr. Chambers spent more than a decade in prison. Two of the women told The New Yorker that Mr. Schneiderman had choked them. Choking is one of the most common forms of domestic violence  according to experts  and it can predict more serious violence to come. None Jarringly in retrospect  when Mr. Schneiderman was a state senator from Manhattan in 2010  he introduced a bill to make intentional choking to the point of unconsciousness a violent felony. The measure was welcomed by law enforcement officials  and it is now New York state law. None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,assault

None “Moll’s a wild one ” someone remarks early in “Beast ” Michael Pearce’s thrilling  unsettling debut feature. With her electric twist of Titian curls and dark  secretive gaze  Moll (a riveting Jessie Buckley) has the look of a volcano that’s primed to erupt. Stirring murder mystery  love story and psychodrama into a mesmerizing slurry  Mr. Pearce turns his native island of Jersey into a sunlit trap where Moll chafes against her domineering mother (an icy Geraldine James) and conservative community. A nasty incident with scissors haunts her past and suggests her mother might have cause to exert control  and when she meets Pascal (Johnny Flynn  perfect)  an insinuatingly handsome poacher  she cleaves to him as one would a kindred spirit. Aided and abetted by Benjamin Kracun’s alluringly sensual cinematography  Mr. Pearce has created a feverish fairy tale riven with dark horrors and forbidden desires. Young women are being raped and murdered  and as suspicion circles Pascal  Moll’s behavior is disturbingly unreadable. Does she truly believe he is innocent  or is she drawn to the possibility that he is not? Bathed in a shadowy beauty and slippery psychological atmosphere  “Beast” soars on Ms. Buckley’s increasingly animalistic performance. At one point  Moll settles into the hole where a body has been found  filling her mouth with damp earth.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/movies/review-three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri-martin-mcdonagh.html,Review: On Violence and the Pain of Others in ‘Three Billboards’ Advertisement Supported by None None None Frances McDormand’s leading turn in “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing  Missouri” is being praised as one of the finest of her career. But that’s no small claim  considering the variety and power of her filmography thus far. “Three Billboards” is more ambitious than Mr. McDonagh’s earlier features. Like the older ones  it has loads of gab  plenty of guns and the spectacle of men (mainly) behaving terribly. It also restlessly  if not satisfyingly  shifts between comedy and tragedy — a McDonagh specialty — splattering blood along the way. This time  though  he has also given his movie characters instead of disposable contrivances  a plot instead of self-reflexive ideas about storytelling and a rather diffuse overarching metaphor. Mostly  he has freighted it with a tragedy that allows the performers — primarily Ms. McDormand but also the equally excellent Mr. Harrelson and Sam Rockwell — to play to their range. The movie opens on low boil with Mildred behind the wheel of her station wagon near three derelict billboards. It’s an inviting landscape smudged with soft color  but as she stares at the signs with furrowed intensity  she chews on a fingernail so ferociously she seems on the verge of tearing it off. The billboards aren’t blank — the faded image of a baby smiles down from one  the word “life” pops off another — but they’re the opening pages in Mildred’s opus. Stamping black text against a blood-red background  she uses the billboards to announce her crusade while Mr. McDonagh (who likes self-aware gestures) lays out the story’s fundamentals: its setting  characters  problem  plot and possible villain. The billboards are a gimmick for Mr. McDonagh and a gambit for Mildred  a way to get things jumping (the investigators  the tale) and splash some foreboding on an outwardly pacific scene. Much of the story involves the ripples of outrage  confusion and buffoonery that the billboards inspire and that soon envelop almost everyone Mildred knows. Months after her daughter’s death  grief has walled her in  isolating and seemingly impenetrable  it is inscribed in the hardness of her gaze and in her grim new identity as a mother of a dead girl. The billboards turn that grief into a weapon  a means of taking on the law and assorted men — a threatening stranger  a vigilante dentist and an abusive ex (John Hawkes) — who collectively suggest another wall that has closed Mildred in. Mr. McDonagh likes to play comedy against violence and to wring laughs out of the unspeakable. This kind of juxtaposition (in his movies  at any rate) can produce laughter that catches in your throat  giving you pause and maybe provoking thought about why exactly you are giggling. But he doesn’t always know his A material from his B  or doesn’t care  his jokes can be uninterestingly glib with tiny  bloodless pricks that are less about challenging the audience than about obscuring the material’s clichés and overriding theatricality. Everything fits together too neatly in “Three Billboards ” even when chaos descends  but the performers add enough rough texture so that it doesn’t always feel so worked. Ms. McDormand roughs it up beautifully. A performer of great unforced naturalism  she has always come across more like a character actor than a star  even when she has the lead. She never seems concerned about losing the audience’s love or its sympathy  which can be thrilling  particularly given that female performers are often asked to pander or seduce. In this movie  she makes pain so palpably all-encompassing that you see it in her character’s every glance and gesture: It squares Mildred’s jaw  hardens her mouth and turns her face to stone  as if she were further fortifying her defenses. But pain also makes her ugly  maybe irredeemable  which also makes her joltingly  excitingly human. That same stone face is good for comedy  too  even if Mr. McDonagh’s bids at humor grow progressively less successful. He plays with tones  realisms and ideas in “Three Billboards ” including the sentimentally redeemed white racist  a character that suggests — despite the rage and invective — that Mr. McDonagh holds out hope for humanity after all. The problem is that the idea he hits most insistently is that vengeance is the hurt that never subsides  it’s the hurt that Mildred nurtures and that hardens her and that  over time  becomes so brutally consuming its violence is all but indistinguishable from its cause. Ms. McDormand still breaks your heart  but Mr. McDonagh just wears you out. Movie data powered by IMDb.com None None None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,assault

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/30/opinion/jews-murder-paris-knoll.html,Jews Are Being Murdered in Paris. Again. Advertisement Supported by Opinion None None None None François Hollande  then president  echoing a chorus of European leaders  pushed back hard  appealing to his country’s Jews: “Your place is here  in your home. France is your country.” Is it? This is a question worth seriously asking following the barbaric murder last week of Mireille Knoll. None Ms. Knoll  85  believed Mr. Hollande. France was her place  her home  her country. And Paris was her city. None None She remained in her apartment in the 11th arrondissement when  suffering from Parkinson’s disease  she was stabbed 11 times. Her apartment was then set on fire. Firefighters found the burned body on Friday night. Parisian authorities are investigating the murder as being motivated by the “membership  real or supposed  of the victim of a particular religion.” But euphemisms should have no place in describing the nature of Mireille Knoll’s death. She was murdered by men apparently animated by the same hatred that drove Hitler. Two suspects  a 29-year-old and a 21-year-old  have been arrested. The older man is a neighbor Ms. Knoll has known since he was a child. The younger  according to reports  is homeless. One of the suspects told the investigators that the other had shouted “Allahu Akbar” while killing Ms. Knoll  according to Le Monde. (A lawyer for the Knoll family  Gilles-William Goldnadel  confirmed that in a phone call.) On Tuesday  Gérard Collomb  the interior minister  told Parliament that one of the attackers had told the other: “She’s a Jew. She must have money.” None It’s a neighborhood that has already borne witness to a nearly identical crime. Almost exactly a year ago  a 65-year-old Jewish widow named Sarah Halimi was murdered by her neighbor  27-year-old Kobili Traoré. Other neighbors said they heard Mr. Traoré scream “Allahu Akbar” as he beat Ms. Halimi  a retired doctor  to near death in the early hours of April 4  2017. He then threw her body into the courtyard below. None This time  French authorities have been quick to call the crime by its proper name. On Monday  President Emmanuel Macron tweeted: “I would like to express my shock at the appalling crime committed against Mrs. Knoll. I reaffirm my absolute determination to fight anti-Semitism.” On Wednesday  he said that she was murdered “because she was Jewish” at a tribute to a police officer killed in an Islamist attack. Mr. Macron has been widely praised by the country’s Jewish community for his moral clarity in describing anti-Zionism as a “reinvented form of anti-Semitism.” Anti-Semitism was supposed to be a disease of the far right. But the people actually killing Jews in France these days are not members of the National Front. They are Islamists. “The major crimes against the Jewish community — Ilan Halimi  the Toulouse killings  the Hyper Cacher killings  Sarah Halimi — all of them have all been carried out by radicalized Muslims ” Robert Ejnes  the executive director of CRIF  an umbrella organization of French Jewish groups  told me in a call from Paris. “These young people have French identity cards  but they hate what France stands for. This is the nature of the problem we are facing. And it’s very hard to talk about.” None None None In the wake of Ms. Knoll’s murder  all of the usual lines are being repeated. Anti-Semitism is the hatred that never dies. Violence that begins with the Jews never ends with them. All of this is true. What’s also true is that anti-Semitism is the oldest hatred in the world because individual people have sustained it in every generation. It cannot be defeated until we look these people and their ideologies in the face. Every French Jew — like millions of Jews throughout history — will have to make their own choice about whether to leave their homes for safer shores or to stay and fight for their rightful place in a country that prides itself on being a beacon of liberty and fraternity. But perhaps the better part of wisdom is with one of Mireille Knoll’s granddaughters  Noa Goldfarb. Following her grandmother’s murder  she wrote in a Facebook post from Israel: “Twenty years ago  I left Paris knowing that neither my future nor that of the Jewish People is to be found there.” None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,assault

Frank ""Cadillac"" Salemme  84  and Paul Weadick  63  participated in the slaying of Steven DiSarro  Assistant U.S. Attorney Fred Wyshak told jurors in Boston federal court. DiSarro's remains were found two years ago. Wyshak said that Salemme confessed while talking to Stephen ""The Rifleman"" Flemmi to killing DiSarro. Flemmi is an associate of Salemme and James ""Whitey"" Bulger  who for a quarter of a century ruled Boston's criminal underworld and is now serving life in prison. Flemmi ""will tell you Frank Salemme told him they killed Steve DiSarro because they thought he was weak "" Wyshak said in his opening statement. Defense lawyers countered that Flemmi  who is serving a life sentence for 10 murders  could not be trusted. Steven Boozang  Salemme's lawyer  said Salemme long ago confessed to eight murders after agreeing to testify against a corrupt agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation  yet he has consistently denied killing DiSarro despite the potential to get a ""free pass."" ""Just because he's done these bad things doesn't mean he's done this "" Boozang said. According to prosecutors  Salemme  a hit man who by 1990 had emerged as the head of the Patriarca crime family in New England  had a secret interest in a South Boston music venue called The Channel  which DiSarro had purchased. In 1993  an FBI agent told DiSarro he would soon be indicted and should cooperate with authorities who were probing Salemme and his now-deceased son  Francis Salemme Jr.  prosecutors have said. Wyshak said Flemmi - who is expected to testify - witnessed Salemme Jr. strangling DiSarro at Salemme's home on May 10  1993 as Weadick held his legs off the ground and Salemme watched. Flemmi soon left  but Salemme told him they killed DiSarro  Wyshak said. Salemme pleaded guilty in 2008 to obstructing justice by providing false information to investigators suggesting others might be responsible for DiSarro's death. Due to his cooperation with authorities  Salemme was placed in the federal witness protection program and lived in Atlanta under an alias. After DiSarro's remains were discovered behind a mill in Providence  Rhode Island  prosecutors say Salemme left his home in July 2016 without notifying the U.S. Marshals Service as required.

None The killing has raised questions about a persistent strain of anti-Semitism in France  “an anti-Semitism that remains  that transforms  that reappears  that mutates ” according to Édouard Philippe  the prime minister. “She survived the Holocaust in the last century  I think she had a happy life  and yet she was killed at home in 2018  frail  and defenseless ” Ms. Dessante said as she was leaving Ms. Knoll’s apartment building after laying flowers on the doorstep. “What world are we living in?” Thousands gathered in Paris on Wednesday to honor Ms. Knoll  marching from the Place de la Nation  on the eastern side of the capital  to her apartment building  a nondescript housing block where mourners had placed candles and flowers on the railings. Many marched in silence  waving French flags or wearing badges with a picture of Ms. Knoll. Samuel Cohen  74  who was at the march with his wife  Léa  70  was one of several who carried a sign that read  “In France  we kill grandmothers because they’re Jewish.” “It would be a little exaggerated to say that we are not safe in France today ” Mr. Cohen said. “Yet it’s true that we are worried  that it’s become hard to practice one’s faith in some areas  and that we’ve reached a new degree of anti-Semitism with this murder.” None None The Representative Council of Jewish Institutions of France  one of the largest Jewish advocacy groups here  known by its French initials C.R.I.F.  said ahead of the march that neither the far-left nor the far-right was welcome to join  arguing that anti-Semites were “overrepresented” on both extremes of the political spectrum. But Daniel Knoll  one of Ms. Knoll’s two sons  said on Wednesday that everyone could come. “The C.R.I.F. is playing politics  and I am opening my heart ” Mr. Knoll said on the French news channel BFM TV. “I open my heart to everybody  everyone who has a mother — which means everybody.” “It’s unbearable  today in France  to know that someone can die like this  in such an atrocious way ” he said. Ms. Knoll was stabbed 11 times  and her body was found partly burned after her attackers tried to set her apartment on fire. One suspect was a neighbor who had often been hosted by Ms. Knoll  while the other was a homeless friend of his. An official close to the investigation  who was not authorized to speak publicly about the case  said that the friend had told investigators that he had heard Ms. Knoll’s neighbor say “God is great” in Arabic during the killing. But the official said the two suspects had given conflicting statements to the police. The French authorities have suggested that Ms. Knoll might have been the target of a theft that escalated  for reasons that remain unclear. But they have also characterized the attack as a worrying sign of anti-Semitism in France  which has been shaken by several recent episodes  including the killing last year of another elderly Jewish woman  Sarah Halimi  which the authorities were much slower to characterize as anti-Semitic. Gérard Collomb  the interior minister  said on Tuesday that one of the suspects in Ms. Knoll’s murder had told the other  “She is a Jew  she must have money.” “These are the stereotypes that are increasingly common in our society and that we must fight against ” Mr. Collomb told lawmakers in the National Assembly. None Her son Daniel was not immediately reachable on Wednesday  but in interviews with the French news media he described his mother  who had Parkinson’s disease  as a woman of limited means and boundless generosity. “Everybody came to see her ” Mr. Knoll told Europe 1 radio. ”If she could have  she would have welcomed the entire world into her home.” One of those frequent guests was one of the suspects  a neighbor who had known Ms. Knoll since he was a boy. “She was nice and naïve ” Mr. Knoll said. “She thought that everybody was good like she was.” In another interview  Mr. Knoll said that on the day of the murder  his wife had found the neighbor with Ms. Knoll in her apartment  drinking port. None France “is confronted today with a barbaric obscurantism  with the only goal of eliminating our liberties and our solidarities ” Mr. Macron said  drawing a parallel between the “terrorist in Trèbes” and Ms. Knoll’s killer  “who assassinated an innocent and vulnerable woman because she was Jewish.” Mr. Macron attended Ms. Knoll’s funeral later on Wednesday  according to the Élysée Palace. In an interview  Meyer Habib  a Franco-Israeli lawmaker in the National Assembly  said that “in the same day  I have a ceremony for a hero who gave his life to save a hostage  then I attend the funeral of an 85-year-old lady who was killed because she was a Jew  and then I’m going to honor her memory at a march.” “That’s my schedule today  and I don’t find it normal ” he said. None Mr. Macron’s government recently announced plans to fight racism and anti-Semitism in France by focusing on prevention in schools and regulation of social media. Back at Ms. Knoll’s apartment building  neighbors described her as a “typical Parisian lady” who would wear a hat and white gloves  and who used to get a haircut every two weeks — a “very coquettish  quick-witted lady who liked to gossip about the neighborhood’s life ” according to her hairdresser  Isabelle Sucher. “She had a lot of style and was so chic  yet so nice ” said Marie-France Sauli  a 63-year-old neighbor who said she hadn’t been able to sleep since the killing. “To attack an old lady who would have never harmed anyone is so cowardly.” Tanguy Garrel-Jaffrelot contributed reporting.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/world/europe/slovakia-journalist-murder.html,Murdered Slovak Reporter Sought to Expose Italian Organized Crime Advertisement Supported by None BRATISLAVA  Slovakia — Before he and his fiancée were killed in their home  a Slovak journalist was investigating a powerful Italian organized crime group  its activities in his country and its possible ties to Slovak government officials  the journalist’s colleagues said on Wednesday. None None Mr. Vadala could not be reached for comment  and he is not quoted in the article. The article’s publication prompted the resignation of high-ranking Slovak government officials. Mr. Kuciak’s report says the major investments that Mr. Vadala and his associates made included farmland  to draw European Union agricultural subsidies. Mr. Kuciak had begun his investigation by looking into how a woman  Maria Troskova  became an aide to Viliam Jasan  a prominent member of the ruling party  and then to Prime Minister Robert Fico. The government had not made clear either her qualifications or her duties. The reporter discovered that Ms. Troskova had previously been a business partner of Mr. Vadala’s  according to the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project. Mr. Kuciak’s published article did not suggest that she had any knowledge of or involvement with the ’Ndrangheta. Ms. Troskova and Mr. Jasan  who headed the government’s crisis management office  resigned from their positions on Wednesday. They said in a statement that they were “shaken” by the killings  “just like the rest of the Slovak public.” “Connecting our names to this atrocious act by some politicians or media is absolutely unacceptable ” they added. “We categorically refuse any connection to this tragedy. But since our names are used in a political fight against the prime minister Robert Fico  we decided to leave our posts at the government office until the end of this investigation.” The culture minister  Marek Madaric  a member of the prime minister’s center-left party  also resigned  citing the killings. “Of all the government  the Ministry of Culture is the most associated with the media ” Mr. Madaric said at a news conference. “As a minister of culture I can’t get over a journalist being murdered.” “Information about a possible breach of any organized group among the politicians  to the level of state institutions  is serious ” he said. “It’s in the interest of us all  of the state  to investigate them as soon as possible — also to avoid making something into a case when it’s not.” None None The killings prompted a host of denunciations from European officials  including Mr. Fico  who said that violence and intimidation against journalists undermined civil society. Mr. Fico announced a reward of one million euros for information leading to solving the crime. Apparently referring to questions about Ms. Troskova  he told reporters  “Do not link innocent people  without any evidence  to a double homicide.” None The group has invested its profits in legitimate businesses in many countries  and in places “has been able to achieve a position of quasi-monopoly in selected sectors  such as construction  real estate and transport ” the report said.

In an open letter published in several Italian newspapers on Thursday  Mr. Pignatone wrote that it was precisely that research that had been the “motive for the murder.” The prosecutor said it was important to reconstruct the “reasons that led him to go to Cairo and to identify the people he met in the academic world and in the Egyptian trade unions.” That  and the claim that Egyptian intelligence officials had knowledge of his whereabouts  had to be the starting points of any further investigation into his death  Mr. Pignatone wrote. And  he added  his Egyptian colleagues agreed. It’s “a result that two years ago we couldn’t be sure we’d ever achieve ” he wrote  alluding to obstacles and resistance that the Italian investigation has come up against. “And we don’t intend to stop at this  naturally. Although we remain aware of the extreme difficulty of this investigation.” Initial investigations in Egypt  later dismissed  offered an array of improbable motives for Mr. Regeni’s killing. At one point  a band of common criminals was fingered. Theories also arose that Mr. Regeni might have been a spy. In the letter  Mr. Pignatone said prosecutors had worked well to “prevent the investigations from ending up on the wrong track.” None Mr. Pignatone wrote that an initial examination of the material showed it was “useful” for the investigation. The letter marks the first time that Mr. Pignatone has publicly discussed the case. In it  he praised the unique and productive collaboration that had evolved over the past two years with his Egyptian colleagues  whom he thanked. Many judicial and cultural obstacles had been overcome to arrive at concrete results  he said. But other obstacles remained. Among them was the slow pace of the investigations  which he said was an unintended side-effect of the collaboration between the two countries. Mr. Pignatone ended his letter by praising Mr. Regeni’s parents and their “unending efforts in the search for truth and justice.” He pledged that Italian prosecutors would do all they could to “bring to justice those responsible for the kidnapping  torture and murder of Giulio ” he wrote.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/16/opinion/church-irs-tax-breaks.html,When Is a Church Not a Church? Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor None Ms. Stewart is the author of “The Good News Club: The Christian Right’s Stealth Assault on America’s Children.” Now that tax day is upon us  consider that through the miracle of tax breaks some of your tax dollars will effectively be going to support groups that finance campaigns against same-sex marriage and gun safety. A number of these groups are also entitled to raise money from other sources for political purposes  without filing the disclosures that are required of other individuals and entities. Why? They’ve got God on their side. Last fall  for example  according to forms filed with the Internal Revenue Service  Focus on the Family  a conservative Christian organization that promotes socially conservative views on matters of public and family policy  declared itself a church. Focus on the Family doesn’t have a congregation  doesn’t host weddings or funerals and doesn’t hold services. What it does do  with its nearly $90 million annual budget  is deliver radio and other programming that is often political to an estimated audience of 38 million listeners in the United States and beyond. It has funded ads against state legislators who support bills intended to prevent discrimination against L.G.B.T. people and it leads programs to combat what it calls “gay activism” in public schools. Why would such a group want to call itself a church? Short answer: money. Churches can raise tax-deductible contributions more easily  and with fewer restrictions  than other nonprofits can. They also enjoy additional tax shelters  such as property tax exemptions for clergy members — or was that conservative radio personalities? Next  churches can also enjoy the benefits of dark money. Unlike other groups  churches are required to disclose essentially nothing about who or what supplies them with their funds. And Focus on the Family  like a number of other groups on the religious right  may worry that its opposition to same-sex relationships will land it on the wrong side of anti-discrimination law. After all  the “moral behavior standards” in their employee guidelines prohibit “homosexual acts.” The Family Research Council  a close partner that for a time merged with Focus on the Family  is registered as a nonreligious nonprofit  rather than as a church. But one of the council’s principal aims is to convert America’s churches  or at least conservative ones  into partisan political cells. It seeks to place what it calls “culture impact teams” in churches to “advance Kingdom values in the public arena.” The way that Focus on the Family and the Family Research Council see it  the Bible offers specific information about how people ought to vote. Scripture  they say  opposes public assistance on principle (“God has charged believers to help the poor and widows and orphans ” the council’s culture impact team manual explains). Apparently  the Bible is also against gun control and supports privatization of schools through vouchers. It tells us that same-sex relationships are an abomination. It does not want women to have access to comprehensive reproductive care. Environmentalism  according to the source the manual recommends to church groups  is a “litany of the Green Dragon” and “one of the greatest threats to society and the church today.” Other sources the manual recommends promote the notion that the earth is 6 000 years old. There is no mystery about which political party the Bible supports  at least as these groups see it. In the run-up to the 2016 election  James Dobson  the founder of Focus on the Family and its former leader  praised Donald Trump and explained that the prospect of a Hillary Clinton presidency “scares me to death.” Their claim that they are nonpartisan is laughable. If you were worried that the amount of money flowing into politics was bad for our democracy  imagine what will happen when you add a divine exception  allowing partisans to spend freely on behalf of their chosen candidates and causes under the cover of churches. Notwithstanding the Johnson Amendment prohibition on direct electioneering by churches  it’s happening in all but name. In 2016 Ralph Reed  the chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition  spoke at the Road to Majority Conference  which brings together politicians and leaders of the religious right. Mr. Reed promised to distribute 35 million “nonpartisan” voter guides through churches and help bring voters to the polls. No one funding his operation  or listening to his speech  could have had any doubt who would benefit from his work. Later that day  after Mr. Reed stepped off the stage  Mr. Trump stepped on to it. The proof of the effectiveness of this political-religious machine can be read from the exit polls of the 2016 election. Four-fifths of white evangelicals supported Mr. Trump. When challenged about their blatantly partisan activism  these groups invariably cry out that their religious liberty is under attack. It isn’t. They are welcome to their opinions and free to expose them to the sunlight of the public square. The real issue here is money and transparency. Tax breaks don’t come free  they’re just ways in which the government allocates your tax money. And if the government is going to allocate money in a certain direction  you should be able to see where it’s going. The process corrupts religion  too. Religion has long thrived in America because most religious leaders respected the separation of church and state  an arrangement that has served our country very well. Under our current law  religious groups are exempt from certain tax and reporting burdens. Political groups are not. Churches need to decide which one they are.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/movies/unsane-review-steven-soderbergh-claire-foy.html,Review: In ‘Unsane ’ It’s Not Paranoia if Someone’s After You Advertisement Supported by None Steven Soderbergh’s new movie  “Unsane ” is an effectively nasty  sometimes funny  sometimes grindingly unpleasant thriller about a woman who is involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital. From one angle  it plays like an old-school exploitation flick  one of those damsel-in-distress freakouts in which an intrepid heroine faces down danger in a skin-baring top. This being Mr. Soderbergh  peril isn’t sloppily served up with flat line readings  jiggling breasts and lousy cinematography but delivered with slyness and jolts. Sawyer — an excellent  febrile Claire Foy  best known for playing Queen Elizabeth II on the Netflix series “The Crown” — is a new arrival in a generic city. She doesn’t say much about herself  but Mr. Soderbergh  a fast  efficient worker  fills in Sawyer’s life with quick  grim strokes — a dire cubicle  nosy co-workers  a predatory boss — and then he lets her out to play. This proves bleaker still. She hooks up with a stranger but when they end up in her apartment she flees to her bathroom. The prescription pills in her cabinet suggest there’s a reason she has fled  and a dark back story emerges piecemeal. Sawyer goes to a hospital to speak with a counselor  revealing that she was a victim of stalking before relocating. This earnest confession leads to her being locked up — ostensibly because she’s a suicide risk — at first for 24 hours. Bad choices and violent encounters extend her stay  which grows progressively more frightening. The chick in the next bed  Violet (Juno Temple  persuasively feral)  keeps harassing Sawyer  though Sawyer is given a friendly welcome by another inmate  Nate (a sympathetic  egregiously badly lighted Jay Pharoah). Then one day while lining up for her meds  Sawyer meets David (a terrific  utterly creepy Joshua Leonard)  whom she claims is her stalker. Written by James Greer and Jonathan Bernstein  the movie plays out as an extended game of cat-and-mouse. Despite some teasing it’s obvious who’s who and what’s what  but if the story holds next to no surprises  it does unload some brutally ugly shocks. Mostly  Sawyer insists that she doesn’t belong in the hospital but doesn’t help her case — she makes one mistake and then another  and consistently refuses to play the good girl — which prolongs her incarceration and torment. It’s easy to get how rotten she feels  especially given that Mr. Soderbergh keeps pushing his camera into Ms. Foy’s face. None None Mr. Soderbergh’s quick-and-dirty approach works here better as a conceptual gambit than as an entertainment. What keeps you watching even as the story becomes more off-putting are the actors and Mr. Soderbergh’s filmmaking. It helps  too  if you ignore the woman-in-peril clichés and sadism and just read “Unsane” as a self-aware riff on the relationship between critics and creators. It’s worth noting that the very first thing in the movie is the sound of crickets. The insect whirring would make an appropriate soundtrack for a country scene  but the glass and concrete crowding our heroine place us in a city. “Crickets” is slang for critics  but maybe the movie’s paranoid vibe is just contagious. Whatever the case  these point-of-view shots of Sawyer  which shift while framing her through foliage  suggest that she is being spied on by a Peeping Tom. (That women’s paranoia is often justified  including in movies  dilutes some of the suspense.) Later  when David earnestly tells Sawyer that he has always loved her  or at least the woman he has fetishized  he sounds like a demented fan  voicing whiny disappointment about betrayal. Sawyer rightly  harshly  puts him in his place. Yet needy  nutty David doesn’t understand. He wants what he wants. And  as he continues hammering Sawyer for not living up to his expectations it is a reminder that why  yes  everyone really is a critic.

Bad men worry about their comeback TV show. Good men who do bad things worry about the impact they have on others. They partake in self-reflection and want to make repairs and amends to those they harmed. Maybe that distinction is a key to how we begin a new conversation about these men. LAURIE KAHN  EVANSTON  ILL. The writer is the author of “Baffled by Love: Stories of the Lasting Impact of Childhood Trauma Inflicted by Loved Ones.” To the Editor: In response to “What Do We Do With These Men? ” sweeping these problems under the rug doesn’t work well. Just ask the Catholic Church  whose leadership created a secret system for passing along their tainted priests from one parish to another  until that blew up  tarnishing the church forever. If men like Matt Lauer  Charlie Rose and Harvey Weinstein are capable of getting therapy and paying back to society for the harm they’ve done  I hope they do so. Frankly  I’m skeptical. I think they’re probably too set in their ways. Maybe I’m wrong  and they’ll prove it by donating millions of dollars to domestic violence shelters  pronto. Sexual assault behavior has to be nipped at an early age. Let’s start raising our boys and girls to not accept this behavior. MOIRA SAUCEDO  ALEXANDRIA  VA. To the Editor: I am the college admissions consultant Katie J. M. Baker refers to who works with young men expelled from school. Before we decide what to do with the “bad men ” we need to determine which men are bad. Ms. Baker notes the spectrum of bad behavior from Bill Cosby to “handsy” salesmen  but we must also acknowledge the spectrum of certainty. In some cases (like Harvey Weinstein)  the evidence is so overwhelming that there can be no doubt about his badness. In contrast  most sexual misconduct cases against students provide little evidence  some of it ambiguous or contradictory. Institutions must make findings based on half-remembered stories of partly consensual encounters  months or years after the fact. Surely many of the accused are guilty of wrongdoing  but which ones? If we are labeling some people as “trash ” we ought to have a lot of confidence about who belongs in the bin. In many cases  we just don’t know. HANNA STOTLAND  CHICAGO To the Editor: As a mental health professional who has been treating sex offenders for almost two decades  I have developed a three-step process leading to a reintegration of offenders into the community. This involves a) a convincing  thorough explanation of motivation  b) recognition and regret of the impact on victims  and c) a pledge that there will be no further incidents. The most important step is the first  requiring confrontational probing to cut through failure to take responsibility and facile rationalizations. An honest explanation in a public forum (for well-known offenders) or to the relevant community is an essential step in achieving both individual behavioral change and a deeper understanding of this issue in the broader community.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/28/opinion/sunday/the-end-of-intelligence.html,Michael Hayden: The End of Intelligence Advertisement Supported by None Mr. Hayden is a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency. In 1994 during the height of the Bosnian civil war  when I was head of intelligence for American forces in Europe  I walked through the ruined streets of Sarajevo. A city of once-beautiful steeples  onion-shaped domes and minarets had been devastated by Serbian artillery in the hills rising above the Miljacka River. I wondered what manner of man could pick up a sniper rifle and shoot former neighbors lining up for scarce water at a shuttered brewery. What struck me most  though  was not how Sarajevans were different from us  but how much they weren’t. This had obviously been a cultured  tolerant  vibrant place that had been ripped asunder by the conflict pitting Muslim Bosniaks against Christian Serbs and Croats. The veneer of civilization  I concluded  was quite thin — a natural thought for an intelligence officer whose profession trends pessimistic and whose work is consumed by threats and dangers. Over the years I had learned that the traditions and institutions that protect us from living Hobbesian “solitary  poor  nasty  brutish and short” lives are inherently fragile and demand careful tending. In America today  they are under serious stress. None [Receive the day’s most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.] President Trump both reflects and exploits this kind of thinking. It is fair to say that the Trump campaign normalized lying to an unprecedented degree. There was the candidate’s claim that legions of Arabs celebrated wildly in New Jersey as the World Trade Center collapsed. He defended his calls for the intentional killing of the Sept. 11 terrorists’ families because “they knew what was happening” and had “watched their husband on television flying into the World Trade Center ” something for which there is zero evidence. He insinuated that Senator Ted Cruz’s father had a hand in John F. Kennedy’s assassination and that the Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia had been murdered. When pressed on specifics  the president has routinely denigrated those who questioned him  whether the “fake” media  “so called” judges  Washington insiders or the “deep state.” He has also condemned Obama-era intelligence officials as “political hacks.” None None We in the intelligence world have dealt with obstinate and argumentative presidents through the years. But we have never served a president for whom ground truth really doesn’t matter. None For many Americans  this is not a problem. Last year  I met a few of them in the back room of a Pittsburgh sports bar where my brother had arranged for several dozen Trump supporters to meet with me. I knew many of them  indeed had grown up with several. But we could have been from different planets. They were angry. They work hard  pay taxes and struggle to raise children  but feel neglected by their government. And Donald Trump is still their guy. “He is an American.” “He is genuine.” “He doesn’t filter everything or parse every word.” None Intelligence work — at least as practiced in the Western liberal tradition — reflects these threatened Enlightenment values: gathering  evaluating and analyzing information  and then disseminating conclusions for use  study or refutation. How the erosion of Enlightenment values threatens good intelligence was obvious in the Trump administration’s ill-conceived and poorly carried out executive order that looked to the world like a Muslim ban. That order was almost certainly not the product of intelligence analysis about the threat posed by immigrants from certain nations  but rather the president trying to fulfill a campaign promise based on exaggerated fears about immigrants and unfair criticism of the refugee vetting system. One former senior intelligence official told me that when the ban was announced internally  everyone was simply told to get on board. None Over time it has become clear to me that security decisions in the Trump administration follow a certain pattern. Discussion seems to start with a presidential statement or tweet. Then follows a large-scale effort to inform the president  to impress upon him the complexity of an issue  to review the relevant history  to surface more factors bearing on the problem  to raise second- and third-order consequences and to explore subsequent moves. None None But the Afghan experience has been the exception. The president continues to attack the Iranian nuclear deal and is likely to end it even in the face of intelligence that Iran has not committed a material breach of the compact  that the deal makes it more difficult for Iran to build a weapon and that it gives us visibility into its nuclear program. None He humiliated the attorney general  undercut his national security adviser and engaged in personal vendettas against senior F.B.I. officials. A few months after Mr. Trump’s inauguration  I got a call from a colleague who thought he might be on a very short list for a very senior position. He asked my opinion. I told him that three months earlier I would have talked to him about his duty to serve. Now I was telling him to say no. “You’re a young man ” I said. “Don’t put yourself at risk for the future. You have a lot to offer. Someday.” When asked for counsel these days by officers who are already in government  especially more junior ones  I remind them of their duty to help the president succeed. But then I add: “Protect yourself. Take notes and save them. And above all  protect the institution. America still needs it.” None That creates a deeper dilemma. Intelligence becomes a feeble academic exercise if it is not relevant and useful. It always has to adapt to the idiosyncrasies  learning style  policies and priorities of any president to preserve its relevance and utility. But there have to be limits. History — and the next president — will judge American intelligence  and if it is found to have been too accommodating to this or any other president  it will be disastrous for the community. These are truly uncharted waters for the country. We have in the past argued over the values to be applied to objective reality  or occasionally over what constituted objective reality  but never the existence or relevance of objective reality itself. In this post-truth world  intelligence agencies are in the bunker with some unlikely mates: journalism  academia  the courts  law enforcement and science — all of which  like intelligence gathering  are evidence-based. Intelligence shares a broader duty with these other truth-tellers to preserve the commitment and ability of our society to base important decisions on our best judgment of what constitutes objective reality. The historian Timothy Snyder stresses the importance of reality and truth in his cautionary pamphlet  “On Tyranny.” “To abandon facts ” he writes  “is to abandon freedom. If nothing is true  then no one can criticize power because there is no basis upon which to do so.” He then chillingly observes  “Post-truth is pre-fascism.” On a recent visit to the C.I.A.  as I was standing near the iconic shield in the grand lobby  I was approached by a young officer who introduced himself and told me his story. Born in Iraq  he became a translator for United States forces during the heavy fighting in Anbar Province. He later made his way to this country  declined an opportunity to attend an Ivy League college and volunteered for the Army. He became a crypto-linguist  working for the National Security Agency  helping fellow soldiers master the intricacies of Arabic. He then joined the C.I.A.  where he was  with obvious enthusiasm  putting his skills to good use. I was at the agency that day to attend the retirement ceremony of a Chinese-American officer who had aided me in my overseas travels  and I got to meet her immigrant parents. I left the headquarters that day with a little more hope than when I entered. For me  that morning felt more like America and its promise than what I was routinely seeing elsewhere. Still  I wondered whether the officers I saw at the ceremony realized how much we are now counting on them. They know we traditionally rely on their truth-telling to protect us from our enemies.

https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/10/world/asia/ap-as-philippines-navy-missiles.html,"Philippines to Launch First Missile-Firing Assault Vessels Advertisement Supported by None MANILA  Philippines — The Philippine navy will deploy its first-ever missile-firing assault vessels in about three months  likely for territorial defense  anti-insurgency strikes and deterrence  but it remains ""centuries"" behind the naval might of Asian countries such as China  the navy chief said Thursday. Vice Admiral Robert Empedrad told a news conference that the navy also plans to acquire torpedoes  submarines and other major defense equipment under a modernization program to bolster the security of an archipelago with one of the world's longest coastlines and to combat piracy and other cross-border crimes. The Israeli-made missiles  which have a range of 8 kilometers (5 miles)  are being installed in three multipurpose attack vessels which were acquired earlier and will be ready for deployment in two to three months  he said. He declined to say how many of the surface-to-surface missiles  called Spike ER  the navy has acquired from Israel's Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd. ""It's a new capability of the navy and since this is our very first missile capability  we really have to study how to operate and where to deploy our ships "" Empedrad told reporters after a maritime security forum in Manila. ""Naval warfare has become missile-based and we cannot afford to be left behind ... we cannot afford to just use a capability installed in our old ships "" he said. ""We have to grow as a navy."" The possible hotspots where the missile-armed vessels could be deployed include western Palawan province and the Zamboanga Peninsula in the country's south  he said. Zamboanga is in a volatile region which faces threats from Muslim militants. Palawan island faces the South China Sea  where the Philippines has been disputing ownership of a chain of islands  reefs and atolls with China  Vietnam and three other governments. Last week  CNBC reported that China has installed anti-ship cruise missiles and surface-to-air missile systems in three areas — Fiery Cross Reef  Subi Reef and Mischief Reef — which Beijing has turned into islands with runways. Vietnam has requested that China withdraw its military weaponry from the three man-made islands  saying its deployment y violates Hanoi's sovereignty  increases tension and destabilizes the region. The Philippine government has expressed concern but has not voiced strong criticism of China's increasingly assertive actions in the disputed waters. Empedrad declined to comment when asked if the Philippine military has taken steps to verify the reported Chinese missile installation and if it plans to secure Philippine-occupied areas with anti-missile systems. ""We are centuries away or maybe years  decades away ... compared to the naval capability of China "" he said when asked how prepared the Philippines was amid the reported Chinese threats in the hotly contested region. The Philippine military  among the most ill-equipped in Asia  has struggled in recent years to modernize its navy  air force and army as it faces an array of national security and territorial threats.

https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/08/sports/baseball/ap-bba-blue-jays-osuna-assault-charge.html,"Jays Closer Roberto Osuna Charged With Assault in Toronto Advertisement Supported by None TORONTO — All-Star closer Roberto Osuna of the Toronto Blue Jays was charged with assault Tuesday and put on administrative leave by Major League Baseball  preventing him from playing for at least a week. Toronto Police declined to say whether it was domestic assault. Constable Jenifferjit Sidhu said the charge is for one count of assault but provided no further details. Osuna  who is from Mexico  is scheduled to appear in court June 18. Administrative leave is not considered discipline. Osuna goes on the restricted list and continues to receive his $5.3 million salary  but is ineligible to play. The Blue Jays recalled right-hander Jake Petricka from Triple-A Buffalo to take Osuna's spot on the roster. The leave lasts seven days  giving the commissioner's office time to investigate. The commissioner's office can request an extension  and Osuna could challenge the leave before Mark Irvings  baseball's independent arbitrator. Commissioner Rob Manfred also has the option of suspending Osuna either without pay  or with pay pending the resolution of legal proceedings — a penalty that later could be converted to without pay. Osuna could challenge any discipline before Irvings. In a statement  MLB said it ""takes all allegations of this nature very seriously"" and is investigating. The Blue Jays released a statement saying they ""fully support"" MLB's decision to place Osuna on leave. ""The type of conduct associated with this incident is not reflective of our values as an organization "" the Blue Jays statement said  adding the team would not comment further because of the ongoing police investigation. The 23-year-old Osuna is 0-0 with nine saves and a 2.93 ERA in 15 games this season. The righty was an All-Star last year when he was 3-4 with 39 saves and a 3.38 ERA. In April  Osuna became the youngest player in big league history to record 100 career saves. Last June  Osuna publicly acknowledged he was dealing with anxiety  saying he was out of sorts mentally and feeling lost. The Blue Jays had planned to give away 15 000 T-shirts featuring Osuna at Thursday's game against Seattle. The team announced Tuesday it was changing the promotion and moving up a giveaway of shirts featuring infielder Yangervis Solarte. Manager John Gibbons said the team will mix and match at closer while Osuna is out  using John Axford  Tyler Clippard and Seung Hwan Oh and Ryan Tepera. General manager Ross Atkins said it was difficult to learn the news of Osuna's arrest. ""You can't express it in words  the feeling that you have "" Atkins said. ""It's a physical feeling  an emotional feeling that you hate to get  you hate to have."" Gibbons said he has a close connection with Osuna but made it clear he doesn't condone assault. ""I love the kid  not because of what he's done for us on the field  but because of who he is and my relationship with him over the years "" Gibbons said. ""But really  in society in general  there's got to be a zero tolerance policy. You've got to protect the vulnerable and those who can't protect themselves."" The Blue Jays were 19-16 going into Tuesday night's game against Seattle. MLB and the players' union agreed on a domestic violence policy in 2015. It allows the league to discipline a player for an alleged domestic violence incident regardless of whether the charges result in a trial. Pitcher Aroldis Chapman was the first player disciplined under when the league suspended him for the first 30 games of the 2016 season. Days later  shortstop Jose Reyes was suspended 51 games. ""What we've seen over the last couple of years is Major League Baseball has taken very strong stances on situations like this one "" Atkins said. ""The punishments have been strong in cases of guilty and not guilty. We support Major League Baseball in that effort."" Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ",assault
