https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/06/nyregion/drone-cellphone-disaster-service.html,It’s Not a Bird or a Plane. It’s a 17-Foot Drone  and It’s Here to Save Your Cellphone Service. Advertisement Supported by None Law enforcement and emergency responders have been using drones to give them an eye in the sky for years. But the unmanned aerial vehicles may soon provide ears as well. Two of the country’s largest mobile phone companies are exploring using drones as flying mobile hot spots to provide phone and other services when cell towers are down or in areas where service does not exist. “After Hurricane Sandy  we lost cell service countywide for several days ” said Martin Pagliughi  the director of the Cape May County Office of Emergency Management in New Jersey. So on a raw day last month  several of Cape May’s emergency responders gathered at a municipal airport in Woodbine to watch Verizon launch a 200-pound drone into the sky. When it reached an altitude of 3 000 feet  a hot spot on board started transmitting a wireless signal. On the ground  members of the Cape May Police Department noted the strength of the service on the Verizon-issued phones they were carrying. “They were testing texting  they were testing voice  they had full coverage in the radius ” Mr. Pagliughi said. Verizon is trying to determine how a portable 4G LTE hot spot could work in an area “where a disaster had impacted Verizon service and there is no other way to get cellular coverage to that location ” said Christopher Desmond  a principal engineer for the company. The trial in Cape May was the company’s second in New Jersey and it reaffirmed the viability of the concept  Mr. Desmond said. Verizon is not alone in exploring the use of drones to help when disasters strike. None “A vast majority of the time” the combination of a truck and a mast will solve the communications problem  said Chris Sambar  a senior vice president at AT&T. “But there are times where what’s needed is a drone.” In addition to providing phone and other data services for emergency responders  Verizon is pursuing other possible uses for drones. “We envision the ability for the aircraft to have a camera onboard to collect the photographic data and beam it to the ground ” Mr. Desmond said  providing situational awareness at the scene and also at a command center. That  he said  would enable better collaboration between those inside and outside a disaster zone. Cape May became a host of the Verizon tests because officials promote the county as a site for commercial drone-development programs. The county has a drone business incubator that houses several start-ups and it has a special certificate exempting it from Federal Aviation Administration regulations that limit drone flights to daylight hours and altitudes under 400 feet. The waiver allows test flights up to 7 000 feet. Because the zone covers a peninsula that juts into the Delaware Bay and Atlantic Ocean  much of the 800 square miles of approved air space is over water or swaths of undeveloped land without cell service  making the area ideal for testing flying cell sites. The pilotless airplane with its 17-foot wingspan is much larger than a hobbyist’s drone. It does not hover and it does not run on batteries. Instead its gas engine supports flights that can be as long as 16 hours  while producing 400 watts of power — enough to control the airplane and feed the electrical needs of a communications hot spot  camera and other onboard equipment. “It’s a unique vehicle  a unique way of carrying sensors with a persistence you can’t get from manned aircraft ’’ said David Yoel  the founder and chief executive of American Aerospace  the company that owns the drone and operates it for Verizon. Before Verizon started testing its aerial hot spot  Cape May had conducted its own tests using a drone from American Aerospace equipped with radio  cell and satellite transmitters. Mr. Pagliughi said he wanted to see how effective the various options might be and that the county would work with any company that could expand the range of airborne service for emergency responders. “I think it is extremely important ” he said.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/learning/falling-gold-phone-manners-bad-citizens-and-great-leaders-our-favorite-student-comments-of-the-week.html,Falling Gold  Phone Manners  Bad Citizens and Great Leaders: Our Favorite Student Comments of the Week Advertisement Supported by Current Events Conversation None None As always  thank you for offering your insightful opinions and sharing your personal experiences. It’s especially heartening to see that some of you are taking time to read and then reply to other students’ comments after posting your own. Keep it up! Please note: All student comments have been lightly edited for length  but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted. _________ None None In this case is wasn’t a pressured betray of beliefs  it was a forced one. None I have lost any respect I might have had for Katy Perry  and I’m not sure that I even had any. The whole debacle was embarrassing and inappropriate. The 19 year old Benjamin Glaze  who received the unwanted kiss  expressed that he was “uncomfortable” with the kiss as it was his first  and had expected his first kiss to be a bit more meaningful. He also said he felt that he “did not feel sexually harassed ” but did Katy Perry know that he wouldn’t when she planted that physical manifestation of romantic intimacy on an individual almost 15 years younger than her? No  she didn’t  and the truth is that she probably didn’t care to consider what he might feel when she made the decision to kiss him. Her behavior can be reflected in the sleazy Hollywood sexual offenders that we all viciously exposed and vilified (and rightfully so  I am in no way defending them)  yet somehow we give Katy Perry a pass? She should be held accountable for sexual misdemeanors regardless of her gender  as should all women. She used her position of power as a reputable judge and artist to force an unsolicited romantic/sexual act on a teenager she’d never even met before  which is harassment and should be treated as such. None Honestly I think his gender has to do something with all this happening too. For men if something like this happened no one would care or they would just care less  because they think he is a man he should like being kissed by women especially if she’s a star  and if he doesn’t like it he’s a cry baby or he should just defend himself. If this was a girl  and a man who kissed her without consent the world would freak out  but for guys they’re told to just be a man about it so what they believe or their thoughts are ignored or joked about even by other guys. This guy’s morals were disrespected because he is expected to just suck it up and be a man about it. What she did was creepy and although she meant no harm I think his morals should have been respected and that you shouldn’t be kissing random people anyway. None I honestly cannot remember a time where I have been pressured to betray my beliefs  but I have definitely pressured another to do so unintentionally. I usually stick to the opinions I have and others often feel intimidated by this and end up agreeing with what I have to say  probably because so many people don’t have a mind of their own if I’m being honest. They’re so afraid of being rejected by others for disagreeing with them or putting up a fight that they just cave in as if that will make them likable. I would rather somebody actually have the brain to disagree with me because it would show that they are an individual that can speak for themselves. None One measure of how strongly you believe in your opinions is how likely you are to stray away from them when pressured. Personally  I haven’t betrayed my beliefs because I would like to say that my opinions are formed through what I  myself  have experienced in my so-far 16 year life. I value sticking to your word greatly  causing me to severely dislike those whom change their opinions in order to fit into the ‘norm’ or to not be ‘singled-out’ for their viewpoints. At the end of the day  I think that you shouldn’t care about what other people think because you should live life the way you want to live it  and not take everything too seriously. Aside from that  I stand somewhat in the middle of the Benjamin Glaze situation. Should she have went up there and given a kiss without asking? No. Should it have been blown up to this proportion in media outlets and have all this hate directed at Katy Perry? No. At the end of the day  Mr. Glaze did say he wanted to ‘Save his kiss for his first relationship’  and Perry should have asked and acknowledged that  as a matter of respect. But what this boils down is into another public-relations catastrophe between TV media and the public  not aiding in the already construed skepticism of mainstream media. None I have been pressured to betray my beliefs a number of times  but I do not impose my will upon others. What Katy Perry did was unacceptable  and it probably messed with his performance in paragraph 11  as he delivered a lackluster performance because he was disappointed that his first kiss was not with someone he loved. None When hearing the news how Katy Perry abused Mr. Glaze’s beliefs  I was shocked. It was not right for her to have tricked him and forced him to kiss her when he wanted to wait for the right person. The article states how he did not want to kiss her because he was raised from a conservative family and wanted his first kiss to be special. He wanted his first kiss to be with someone special and Katy Perry disrespected his religious beliefs. I admit I have been pressured to change my beliefs because of other people. I remember in elementary school my friends were different than the ones in preschool and expected more from me. I was expected to practice cheerleading and spend recess talking and sitting rather than running around  swinging from the monkey bars  which was an activity I enjoyed. One year later I realized that I did not want to be someone’s personal cheerleader and I went back to playing on the playground. I do not let others tell me what to do because I have learned that pressure makes me feel guilty and overall not happy. None I have been pressured to do something and it is not a good feeling. I have been pressured when I was playing softball in middle school and I was the last one up to bat and they all counted on me. Everyone was quiet and they were all staring at me and just were telling me that I could do it but I just felt really pressured because if I didn’t hit the ball we were going to lose the game. At the end of the game we had won and I had hit the ball and I brought my teammates home but I had so much pressure on me. None In order for movements like #MeToo to be successful  it cannot be subjective. I am a huge proponent of feminism and I strive to spread awareness and equality anyway I can  but the definition of feminism  in my opinion  is that men and women are equal. It is contradictory to hold this belief and think that it is okay for Katy Perry to kiss a teenage boy  just because she is a woman. She should be held to the same standard that we would hold a 33-year old man to if he were to kiss an unwilling teenage girl. Her actions put an innocent teenager in a highly uncomfortable position  one that is common for young women: A higher powered person preying on defenseless subordinates. Of course Benjamin didn’t say he wouldn’t kiss Perry - it is hard enough to tell somebody that holds your future in their hands “no” when you aren’t on national television. It is fair to say that Benjamin was pressured into forsaking his beliefs  but so are all of the feminist  or even semi feminists out there saying things like Benjamin was lucky  or that what Katy did was cute. This issue spreads its wings outside of this one (horrible) incident  all the way to the feminist movement as a whole. If we ever want true equality these are the times that we have to stick to our guns and make sure what we say and believe about situations outside the norm of the feminist issue column remain consistent with what we would think if the roles were reversed. None I have never felt pressured to betray my religion. When I hear this question I start to think about Muslims feeling pressured to eat pork or Christians feeling pressured to have sex before marriage. To answer this question I would say I  as a Christian  have never felt pressured to betray my beliefs or religion. None I don’t believe what Katy Perry did was right  specifically because if the genders were swapped  there would be massive backlash. I understand why she did it in the moment  she probably thought he had never kissed someone because he never had the opportunity or something  and Katy “gave him that opportunity.” But as Benjamin stated  if Katy had asked him  he would’ve said no. Therefore  there was not consent  and we make a big deal about consent in society when men act without it  and women should be pressured to get consent too. None This is sexual assault. It might not be as extreme as other stories  but it still stands. Guys are held to a different standard than girls when it comes to sex  think about how much outrage would surface if the roles were switched. Imagine if a 30 y/o guy kissed a 19 y/o girl  it would be madness in both real life and on social media! But  when a guy is assaulted  people are proud of him and “jealous”. They are told to “man up” and that “you are so lucky!” The whole thing just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. _________ None None If I’m being fairly honest  I applaud Mr. Hagerman. Is it responsible? No  not exactly. From the choice he’s made  he isn’t exactly a “good citizen” by American standards  seeing as though he isn’t speaking out and making sure he is carrying out his civic duties. But can we really blame him? This man survived through the constant news reports on Black children and adults wrongfully being killed by our own policemen on a monthly basis. He observed his TV screen helplessly as a bar in Florida was shot down by one hostile man simply because of the fact that it was meant for people who are attracted to the same sex. He lived in an America where he watched a grown man yell childishly about his personal 1st world problems  gloat to other men like him about how he takes pride in assaulting women  then proceed to win the American presidency. The list goes on and on. Erik Hagerman did something for himself  he ran away from the issue and stopped paying attention. This does make him selfish and irresponsible  but who acted wrongfully first? He saw the President being irresponsible with his power  the police being irresponsible with their guns  and the citizens being irresponsible with their rights. He saw America being reckless and impulsive  and he chose to no longer be a part of it. Unlike everyone else’s actions  this selfish act made him happier. So though I don’t necessarily agree with him  I condone his abrasive choices. Cheers to a life in peaceful solitude! None I believe that Mr. Hagerman’s decision to ignore all news was highly irresponsible and silly. As citizens of the United States  we are supposed to know what is going on in the world  and help our government deal with problems. Our government was created so we the citizens could interact and change what we wanted  but if we don’t know what is going on the government could take over. Also  if we don’t pay attention to news  we can miss major events that could threaten our life. For example  there could be a mass shooting or a war that we have to fight in  but we would have no idea that these events were happening. None In this day in age  everybody needs to have time to themselves  without a constant overflow of information  just like Mr. Hagerman. Having time to think  even if it is just for a few minutes  is crucial to being well balanced. I applaud him for taking on such a large undertaking  and trying to look within himself to find satisfaction rather than at the tumultuous string of current events. None We live in a society of information overload and news is one area that seems to get the most attention. As a high school student  it makes a lot of sense to understand what is happening around the U.S.  to help prompt discussion in the classroom or at home. Adults should have a basic understanding of what is happening around the world  since it could impact decisions you make in your life. So  I feel all citizens should make an effort to keep up with the news. But  do we need to be inundated by TV  tweets  online articles  constantly  24 hours per day? Do we need to be experts on every topic and hold a strong opinion on each one? No way! As Mr. Hagerman said  “I had been paying attention to the news for decades  and I never did anything with it.” There is much truth in that statement  because we rarely make major personal decisions based on what you read or hear on the news. Plus  do we really need to keep hearing about the same issue over and over for days on end? But we should be aware of the issue. His Blockade of all news is a bit extreme  but I applaud him for his efforts. Instead of blockading the news  each person must develop their own way of getting the news they need. Our individual challenge is to determine the best source for news which meets our personal situation and develop the discipline to not partake in the 24 hour a day news frenzy. Develop your own method for getting the news  so that you can be a good citizen and be aware of the issues and take appropriate actions if needed. None Being in high school  I can relate to the feeling of wanted to stay away from the drama that I don’t understand or approve of. But I think that totally ignoring everything that’s going on around you  and in your government  is a bit too much. It is important to know what’s going on around  so you can prepare yourself for what might come. On top of it all  just because he doesn’t support the leader of the country  doesn’t mean that he should avoid everything that’s going on within his country  making him a bad citizen because he isn’t supporting or having any concern for his country. None In my opinion Mr. Hagerman is taking the 2016 election way too far. I understand being upset about your candidate not winning  and I would also understand if he had followed through with his original plan of only protesting a few days  however a year is unbelievable. The media is used for more than just government news  granted the media does seem to focus on that subject quite often  even then he could just turn the channel if he is watching the news on TV  whenever a political subject appears. I feel that it is kind of our responsibility as citizens of the United States to be up to date on America’s news along with global news  global warming for example  if people are up to date on the current issues  they could do their part to help solve these issues. Therefore  Mr. Hagerman should stop his ”silent protest” and become more aware of what’s going on in the world. None The simple answer is yes  if you don’t keep up with the news then you are a bad citizen. When you isolate yourself from your own country you shouldn’t be considered a citizen. Everyone should know what is going on in the nation because it’s their nation. When you don’t know what’s happening then it’s the same as not caring for you country. _________ None None I think this image is trying to explain that when one is in a stressful situation  it’s best to have positive interactions that reinforce a sense of belonging and being cared for. In this case  it’s getting a hug. When someone is in a bad place  they usually don’t want to hear “I told you so ” hence the smaller need for facts and lectures. I agree with this message to an extent. Mainly because hugs or affirmation in general  can only do so much and to function many people need to understand the consequences of their actions or need to be motivated to do so. None In my opinion  I think the image is relaying the importance of physical contact during times of intense stress. Cortisol  a hormone responsible for stress  is lowered considerably through hugs. Although most people try to put on a tough act of not needing physical contact with others  almost everyone feels better with hugs. 11th grade is arguably the hardest year for a high school student  with all the AP Exams and SATs/ACTs. I know that whenever I cuddle my cat  I become relieved and de-stressed almost immediately. None This image portrays the idea that people going through hard times need love and support  rather than facts and lecture. While this is true to some extent  love and hugs don’t fix your problems. I relate to this  but in sort of a different way. When I go through tough times in my life  I cope by listening to music. The words spoken and the music played are my version of hugs and support. To listen to someone writing about similar problems lets you know you aren’t alone  and that there is hope in the future. This version of sympathy resonates with me stronger than any other. I also agree with the fact that LECTURE only makes things worse. This is why the graph shows an upside down bar. Nobody wants to be yelled at constantly when they are in a distressed state. It can only hurt. None The image portrays how in scary times  either with a test coming up or dealing with a loss  the most important and beneficial thing we need is comfort. Being lectured or yelled at when anxiety is high never helps to ease the worry. As the article mentions  with the downfall of the current stock market  some people are finding themselves scared. The best way to overcome this is having someone who will listen to you  provide you with comfort  listen to your worries and provide kind comments to ease your stress. Once you are able to release some stress and be more rational  then  you can start reworking and thinking about how to handle the situation. I agree with the message the image portrays. Whenever I’m going through a tough time  I don’t want to be lectured about how I’m doing something wrong or how to fix the problem. The first thing I want is someone to just listen to what I have to say and affirm me  that everything will be okay. After I’m calmed down  then I can start figuring out how to approach the situation and a rational way to deal with it  but I need that emotional support at the beginning. You can’t go wrong with a hug. _________ None None Singing has been something that I personally have been very passionate about since I can remember. Performing is something that I have become passionate about in recent years and these two activities combine into something that gives me a rush of adrenaline. The feel of performing in front of people with a few of my friends makes the experience blissful and makes me feel powerful. Singing and performing makes me feel more alive and gives me a joy that nothing else can give me  which is why I continue to do so as often as I can. None I can definitely see why Mr. Doba felt the way he did about the kayaking. There is something about being one with nature that takes you back to your roots. With feeling wild and free  there is almost always a sense of ferality as well  because most of the times when you are your most wild and free  you are doing things in nature. When reading about his excursion  I immediately was overcome with great admiration for the man  at 71  who crossed the Atlantic Ocean via kayak. I then read about all of the harsh conditions that he endured  and all of the things that happened to him physically  such as almost losing all of his nails and having his clothes become so salty that he couldn’t wear them anymore. The one thing that makes me feel alive is swimming. I swim 6 days a week  for a team  but when I swim I feel alive. I believe I feel this way because when I am swimming  I have time to myself  time to think  this makes me feel alive. I hope that when I am Mr. Doba’s age  I do things to push myself and stay active. I would like to hike  ski and hopefully still swim when I am 71. None I feel like the two main ways to make you feel most alive are to either do something competitively where you give it your all or put your life on the line. Some people may say well how is kayaking fun or thrilling? Well Doba is both putting his life on the line as well as competitively trying to break records such as greatest number of days paddles by a Polish man in a single year. Doba would even go as far as to kayak in the Baltic Sea while the Communist Party declared it illegal. When Doba’s phone stopped working he pressed the help button on his spot device. When they came to rescue him instead of hopping aboard and going to shore to get his phone fixed he refused to leave his kayak and requested for his phone to be fixed. If you are still unable to understand the thrill  just think of a roller coaster. While riding a roller coaster you know that if something goes wrong you may die. It is this risk that gives the thrill. None Ask any of my friends: the first  well  nine months after every summer vacation are spent telling them about the beauty of dirt under my fingernails  how much fun sleeping in a tent is  and the thrill of reaching a summit  among hundreds of other details. I understand Mr. Doba’s feeling while he kayaks  there is a certain je ne sais quoi about pushing your body to reach a certain goal. While reading this article  I was overwhelmed by reverence for this man who dedicated his life to seemingly impossible goals. For example  when Doba proposed kayaking across the North Atlantic  his trip was deemed impossible  and even deadly. However  Doba ventured to prove them wrong for the sake of his objective to cross the Atlantic in the southern  middle  and northern routes. This intense goal setting is something that I see reflected in my teammates on my crew team  they push themselves to their limits on the daily in order to reach their goals. Sometimes barely able to exit their boats  they beam after winning a race or PRing on a piece. Another kind of ecstasy that I observe is when I am in the backcountry with my friends. I hope that when I am Mr. Doba’s age I can continue to row and hike  hopefully still with friends by my side! None When I am standing in the front of the classroom  seeing the numerous eyes of my peers and dead silence  I feel most alive. To have the attention of every person in the room  for a topic that I care about immensely  that for me is like crossing the Atlantic. For that brief moment that I was pitching my ideas for our school newspaper in my journalism class  I felt that I had accomplished something. Of course  all students were required to share their story ideas  but I felt like I had been Mr. Doba during the last few miles of his journey. To do something that you are most passionate about is where life comes from. Anybody can live  but it takes devotion to your passions in order to be fully alive. None Mr. Doba uses a Polish word  katorga  to describe the suffering he endures while completing excruciating kayaking trips repurposed as determination and an “existential thrill.” I can see that  having been at sea for 110 days without face-to-face social interaction and having to weather through nature’s toughest obstacles  he would look “ecstatic and feral … intrinsically wild and free.” His kayaking trip must have reminded him  shockingly  of his undeniable state of being. As someone who faces a constant and daily war with mental health  sometimes I struggle to truly feel alive. The burden of mental illness can make it difficult to find passion  or motivation  or even to muster energy to get out of bed. There are  undoubtedly  things that make me happy. Simple things make me feel alive: playing music  running  or just laughing with my friends. Despite these things  I feel like I have an existential crisis every day. There is one thing I’m confident about: I want to live  and experience life to its fullest. It’s my dream to do something arduous and taxing yet gratifyingly so  something that can remind me of my presence in the universe  something exhilarating like backpack across a continent  or bike cross-country  or climb a mountain. Those are all difficult to obtain as a full-time student and teenager  but they’re 100% on my bucket list. Mr. Doba is certainly an incredible man  and he has inspired me to do something crazy yet existentially fulfilling. _________ None None There are many characteristics of being a great leader. When I think of a great leader  they should be honest. Being honest and gaining people’s trust is important. You have to set good examples for others to follow  so  having their trust does come in handy. A great leader should be someone who is respectful  intelligent  strong  and confident. People turn to leaders for help and someone they can talk to without a problem. Leaders should be respectful towards their peers and loyal those they are leading. A great leader means you are confident in your beliefs and you take risks to help your ‘followers’. A leader who is intelligent in what they are leading others to is important. You want your peers to be able to have confidence in you and not doubt you. Leaders should have an open  positive mind. A leader should stand out and be known. People should be able to look up to their leaders. Everyone has the ability to be a great leader. It’s just a matter of if you’re willing to put in the effort. None In my opinion  a great leader is someone who puts others needs before their own needs. A great leader needs to have power with their words  they need to be able to motivate someone else to do something that they never thought they could do. Great leaders may not be the best at what they do  but they can create other people who are. Great leaders are hard to find because so many people would rather see themselves succeed than the people who they are “leading”. Men and women can absolutely be equally effective leaders. Being a great leader is not about your appearance  it is about how you act and what your morals are. Anybody can be a great leader  but many times men are more outspoken and arrogant than women and many people perceive outspoken and confident individuals as leaders since they are usually the first to speak. This  however  has nothing to do with being a true leader. A great leader does not have to say the most  they just have to say enough to motivate people. None The stereotypical leader is someone who possess the qualities of being decisive  independent  courageous  often times loud  and has a bold presence. While I agree that some leaders possess these qualities  I think that every leader has their own unique character. A leader is something who stands out  who takes the extra step to be noticed — even if it not intentional. Going to an overnight camp for the past nine summers  I learned to become a more independent and courageous person. These skills that I gained I thought made me more mature  but many people told me that they made me a better leader. This was surprising because I did not consider myself to be a leader. I thought leaders are supposed to be loud — I’m quiet  leaders are supposed to be decisive — I am very indecisive  and I do not have a bold presence — I just blend in with everyone else. However  I then realized that is what made me a leader: my differences. Sometimes we do not recognize leaders because they are not what and who we expect them to be. Leaders are often overlooked by others because of how they look  from their gender  and from their personality. Opinions are often form by someone’s first impression  and although first impressions are important we have to get to know others before labeling or characterizing others. Everyone has the ability to be a leader whether they realize it or not. Sometimes we just need a little help finding our voice to channel the inner leader hiding inside. Many students also commented on the reasons women are less likely to be perceived as leadership material  and why recognizing these stereotypes is important. None Sadly  I am not surprised people imagine leaders as men. In our society we still see many more men in leadership positions  a great example of this is the fact that America has had only male presidents. This looming fact and the lack of representation of females in powerful positions creates a stigma. In all of the drawings of leaders people believed that strong leaders were good listeners  decisive  caring  and well educated. Women and men can both be equally strong in any of these and all qualities. In my own experience as a leader I have not been taken less seriously because I am a woman but it was harder for me to get to where I am now. Many people believe that women and especially teenage girls are afraid to speak in large groups and handle the attention that comes with needing to be a leader. Girls need to put in more work to get those opportunities that boys have simply handed to them. Being a leader means being a good listener but also following you gut and representing a group in the best way you know how. This has nothing to do with your gender  being a good leader is all about having strong leadership skills. Both women and men can have these skills but women have to work harder to get the opportunities to show off these skills. None Great leaders are intelligent  competent  empathetic  organized  and assertive. He or she cares about what their employees think  respects their coworkers  and takes the time to listen to their worries or suggestions. Given these qualities  I see no reason why women and men can’t be equally effective leaders  for these characteristics are taught and learned  not born into. We should focus on teaching young girls to be less passive and obedient and more confident and assertive  as well as showing more children female leaders along with their male counterparts. Besides this  I think the medias we’re constantly exposed to should put more thought into the content they’re creating  as many stereotypes and sexist beliefs can be enforced by what they broadcast. A common trend I’ve noticed on TV shows is that female leaders are often depicted as bossy and rude  and the main characters gripe about her and make derogatory remarks. This scene (and other sketches/jokes like it) are often brief and mindless  but as other shows repeat the same material  the stereotype is reinforced in the minds of the viewers. This isn’t the sole reason women aren’t seen as leader-like/good leaders  but it does contribute to the spread and resilience of such stereotypes. The good news is  we have been improving. More women are taking an interest to political and economic leadership positions  and more people are noticing this. One day  it will never be doubted that women can be leaders. None A great leader possesses clear visions  honesty  humility  courage  integrity  trust  et cetera. Although it is significantly more difficult for women to assume leadership positions  women still have the capability of becoming just as good of a leader as a man. Leadership is defined by the leader’s positive attributes  not their gender. A woman can be just as hardworking  courageous  honest  and trustworthy as men. In my personal experience  my leadership has not been doubted in academic classes  only physical classes such as physical education. Because I have earned the reputation of being intelligent based on my grades  I have never had my intelligence or leadership in group projects questioned. However  in gym class  my leadership is questioned constantly. I am one out of only three females in my class. Because I am a female  the males in my class assume I am not as athletic or not as talented at sports as them. Therefore  the other girls and I are always picked last for games. Although I do not object or try to take on a role of leadership  I always do my best to prove the boys wrong. None In my opinion  a leader can be a female or a male. A leader’s greatness isn’t defined by their gender  it’s defined by their qualities and actions. Gender shouldn’t really matter as long as they meet all of the standards. To me  a great leader is someone you can look up to  someone that always does the right thing  is intelligent  a good listener  honest  has good communication skills  sets good examples  and is just a good person overall. Typically  when people think of leaders I feel like they think of males no matter the situation. It’s important to recognize these stereotypes because some women may have great leadership skills  and be overlooked because they aren’t male. I feel like that’s wrong because females can do just as much as males can in my opinion. _________ None None I hate it when people go on their phones in social situations  whether it is during dinner  at a party or during a conversation. It is rude  and extremely inconsiderate. Whenever I am talking to a friend  (teenagers are notorious for being tech addicted)  and they are looking down at their phone  I feel like they do not care about what I have to say. Obviously  whatever they are doing on their device is more important than what I have to say. If you have ever looked at those photos of teenagers sitting next to each other  all looking down at their screens and laugh  just take a deeper look about what is happening. A new generation is growing up  being technologically adept and socially inept  generally speaking. Smart phones should not take the place of real interactions  which have become ever more valuable in a tech addicted world. None I think that there are many cases in which people overuse their phones to a rude extent. One major red flag for inappropriate phone usage is when out at a restaurant. If you go out to eat  you should be enjoying the experience. It is disrespectful to the staff of the restaurant to be focusing upon a cell phone instead of the food and service that they are providing. Also  if you are talking on a phone  you may be disrupting other people within a close vicinity. Even more appalling is the treatment of who you are spending time with. There is not much worse than seeing people out to eat and having one person on their phone completely ignoring the other. All too often  people focus on their phone instead of the people that they are spending time with. While cell phones and new technology are great assets in many situations  when they take away from personal interactions they become a problem. People should continue to appreciate the people around them instead of being sucked into their cell phones and distracted in order to use phones appropriately. None For me  I tend to completely check out of the conversation when someone is focusing more attention on their phone than to what’s happening in the real world. When people are more interested in who they’re snap chatting at the moment or who just added a new Instagram post than hanging out with their friends  it shows a new level of rudeness. A lot of times when I’m hanging out with a group of people  or even just one person  I look around and everyone is sitting in silence with their nose in their phones. It bugs me to the core and sometimes I wish I lived in the time when phones weren’t as accessible. I’m sure people would get to know one another better and form real life connections. As the article states  “Etiquette  manners  body language  the way we respond  interact and even look is changing ” and sadly it’s true. The days when people actually held eye contact and were 100% present in a conversation are slowly slipping away as society starts to put our phones first and the people right in front of us second. None We all are familiar with the phone-obsessed-people-who-are-ruining-human-interaction trope. Especially as a teenager  it seems that every time I go out with friends people are always glued to their phones  checking Instagram  and sending snaps. However  phone use in conversation is not inherently evil. Phones are devices that are meant to enhance communication  and are mostly used to connect with others rather than ignore them. Obviously  you should not check your texts while listening to your friend recount the death of their beloved dog or any other such topic requiring emotional support. But often in conversation  we check our phones to look up relevant information  contact others in order to include them  or to share pictures of our latest exploits with the people we are with. While there are times when it is disrespectful to use phones when another human being is talking to you  that is not always the case  and most of us are good at using our discretion. None Ever since I was first given a phone  it has been a clearly stated rule that there would be no phone use at anytime during dinner. Whether we’re at a fine restaurant or just dining in at home  the only contact my mom allows is real face-to-face interaction. This strict cellphone ruling has been ingrained in me at this point  keeping me off my phone in most interactions. Being able to have a disconnect from my phone has allowed me to see so many other people completely negate any social interaction just because they care too much about their own cellphones. Researchers at the University of Michigan have suggested that “empathy levels have plummeted while narcissism is skyrocketing.” This makes total sense. Our generation is being taught that it is okay to ignore and belittle whomever they are with. These teens and young adults needs to learn that whatever it is that’s on their phones is minuscule in comparison to the interactions they could be having in the real-life world. None I’ll admit  from time to time I find myself looking at my phone instead of interacting with the group I’m in. I am not proud of it  and I may sound like a hypocrite commenting on this topic  but I feel like we should all put our phones down when we are with other people. I feel like most of us look at our phones when we are hanging out with people because we sometimes feel awkward talking others. Instead of being social and talking with others  we resort to looking at our phones to make ourselves look busy. We even will look at our phones with nothing on the screen to avoid the awkward social interaction. In the article  a statistic states that 75% of Americans believe that smartphones don’t impact the group setting  but I feel like it has the biggest impact. Some of life’s greatest moments happen when you are hanging out with others  and if all you are doing is looking at your phone  you might as well just be sitting at home by yourself. We should all put down our phones when we are hanging out with others. Maybe if you do this  you may learn something brand new about a person  and you may become better friends with that person. You can not build relationships behind a phone screen. _________ None None In my county  one in four children are food insecure. We have free and reduced lunch programs and in some schools children are given backpacks with food for break times  but I can’t imagine how they get through spring break with maybe not much more than that backpack of food. I feel like the part of the article about being “keenly aware of their own economic disadvantage” over spring break is really true  because while I live in a city near the beach  there are kids right here that have never seen the ocean. I frequently go to the beach with my family and friends  so to hear about my classmates going all the time if I’d never been would be torturous  not to mention the more extravagant vacations to the Bahamas  Turks and Caicos  Disney World  and elsewhere. I definitely think all colleges should keep their cafeterias open over spring break for those who would be food insecure otherwise  or even for those who aren’t able to go home like the author. I feel like public elementary  middle  and high schools should adopt this policy as well  though I realize the reality of transporting these kids to cafeterias might not be feasible for those outside of walking distance to their schools. This could be remedied if school buses were still to operate and bring children to their school cafeterias over spring break. There’s really no reason that children should go hungry in America  so I hope that this changes with access to food being more accessible in the near future. None I felt that universities should be doing more to provide the basic necessities to their students. However  just like most boarding schools  they leave their students to fend for themselves. The school should at least provide a little bit of support as the tuition is not cheap. In addition  in the article  it states that one of the students rely on microwaveable food for his meals which I doubt is healthy so the schools are impacting the student’s health. The schools should also allow students to stay on campus during spring break for free instead of charging them a fee. This gives students who aren’t traveling some extra cash to spend which takes economic pressure off them. The students are given the choice to use the kitchen to cook their food which is cheaper than buying food. Overall I feel that schools are doing a pretty bad job at keeping students fed. None Some of my friends get lunch from the cafeteria. They always complain about how terrible the food is. They have things like pizza  french fries  and hamburgers every week. Whenever I can  I try to give them something from my lunch. I agree with the paragraph which states not having enough food can affect your school performance. I believe this to be true. If you are constantly hungry and always thinking about food during tests  that would be terrible. I couldn’t imagine trying to concentrate in school while being hungry. The data from the article surprised me that 1 in 4 college campuses open their cafeterias during breaks. Honestly  I thought there wouldn’t be that many. As mentioned in the article  most students travel off campus for spring break and other events. Now that I think about it colleges really should have their cafeterias operating for anyone who is staying on campus. None I personally have not experienced food insecurity  nor do I know of anyone who openly spoke about their own experience. The students mentioned in the article should never have to feel different from the other students who can afford to leave campus on spring break. Not knowing where your next meal would be coming from can definitely make you feel “keenly aware” of your own economic disadvantage  which these closed cafeterias do. If I saw my peers leaving campus to go on vacation or to go home and I knew I couldn’t afford it  I would automatically feel bad about myself. With schools like Columbia and Harvard that changed their spring break-cafeteria policy  progress was made. Of course  more steps in the right direction should be made other than a change of policy and free lunch for all grade levels. More schools should continue to take into consideration the student’s advantages and disadvantages and cooperate to benefit all students  not just a handful. _________ None None While looking at this image I can’t help but think of the seven deadly sins with lust  gluttony  and pride placed to obviously in the foreground. More subtly in the foreground however  I noticed the crowd  a strange cast of characters themselves. I believed this was to represent how a person views characters in a story  how one may raise themselves up thinking  “at least I’m not like them” while only interpreting the grossest of exaggerations. To be terrible  but not that terrible  ironically engaging in pride. As I read the article  I understood it was intended to portray the evil and their tragedies  “Dost thou hear  Hal? Never call a true piece of gold a counterfeit: Thou art essentially mad without seeming so.” Also  and more lightheartedly  it intended to portray a message of living life for what it is worth  “But to counterfeit dying when a man thereby liveth is to be no counterfeit but the true and perfect image of life indeed.” This was interesting to me since the author  Bloom  takes heavy inspiration from Shakespeare  whose tragedies don’t show much mercy. I agree with the writer of the article  Winterson  that Bloom’s writing is a sort of breath of fresh air to language. None I would describe this picture as messy  silly  comic  outrageous  but full of life (see where I’m getting). I think it relates to how Harold Bloom presents Falstaff. Bloom rebirths Shakespeare’s concept of to live for versus to die for. Even so in a way that brings liveliness to the reader or follower  which can relate to the crowd that looks alive and active as the drama takes place in front of them in the picture. I admit my first impressions on this image was a cringe. My head started to hurt as I tried to capture and focus on the drama that takes place on the frame. But I also believe that the illustrator did to me what bloom does to his students. Giving me first an uncomfortable feeling and then bringing me to a glimpse of interpretation thanks to some help from the article. None Ah! What a blasted vision of society and the music is just like a fine brandy! If I still had a say  I would give the accordionist a finer dress and at least a broad audience  I mean can they even see how awestruck the queen is. Of course  the king has other needs to tend with a withering stare. Just seeing him caress the sweatband of that plump drunkard sends a nasty growl through my pale gut. They laugh and drink as love dies  of how a noble-lady could ever fall in love with a black peasant. Blast those two to all seven layers of the inferno  for love is love! That is where I must mention this sad sap  still mourning over the skull of his mistress. I know for she is here next to me  but her voice is as silent as days since her passage. Wait  blimey! A pixie  why I have always thought of them to be no more than old wives tales. Oh  well the way he continues to eye the drunkard’s wine  I assume he intends to spike it for his sins. Bah! What do I know  I’m simply a ghost behind the scenes  just choosing to lament somewhere more reflective. _________ None None Gold falling from the sky? Cmon that’s ridiculous! Well in Yakutsk  where temperatures can plummet to minus 85 degrees Fahrenheit  it happened. Yes  precious gold fell from the sky  and not just a couple ounces of it. More than 3.4 tons of gold was recovered from the runway  however this NYT article did state that  “They turned out to be doré  a semi-pure alloy composed of gold and silver  not pure gold  but close enough”. Besides that’s still a lot of gold and gold is worth a lot. In fact one ton of pure gold alone is worth a little over 64 million dollars. That’s enough money to buy 60 of the highest class sports cars on the market. Although I wish gold would fall from the sky in my town  I know it’s very unlikely. I live in a beach town  so I am blessed to see beautiful sunshine falling from the sky most everyday. I know sunshine isn’t as valuable as gold  but in my mind it is. None The most interesting thing I have ever seen come from the sky may just be anything frozen. It’s pretty hard to recall because considering where I live  having the terrain frozen like it is in Yakutsk  or seeing any precipitation other than rain or sometimes ice is very rare. This article brought a positive imagery  I could see a short time span of gold blocks raining out of the sky in what was an epic moment for the ages  only to later turn out to be an accident that fell out of a plane  which left me loaded with questions. Where was a plane taking that much doré? Why so much? Who put that much a burden on a plane? I guess the moral of this story is how the irony can make someone’s day (like it made mine  with the imagination)  but also ruin it like it did those who sought an opportunity to grab riches that fell from the sky. None Had to be a plane. Maybe the pilot sneezed and hit a button. I wish I was there to cash in on some free gold. The strangest thing I’ve seen falling from the sky would have to be a waterspout. I was out in the boat roughly 30 miles offshore of OIB. The next thing I know is my dad hollerin’ ayyyy there’s a waterspout bout a mile out. So I turn and saw this water tornado that I thought was gonna suck us right up! Now that I look back on this I laugh at how I thought spinning water would eat me. None It is hard to believe that 3.4 tons of gold fell straight from the sky in Yakutsk. I think it was some sort of aircraft that just happened to drop loads of it on the ground. Now I can’t really tell where this picture was taken place but in the background that definitely doesn’t look like a normal road. It is a lot wider so it could possibly be an airport or something and a plane dropped the gold as they were flying in the sky. Come to find out  after reading the article it was an airport! I can’t imagine the people’s faces when the shiny material had fallen to the ground. It’s unbelievable! The most alluring thing that I have EVER seen in the sky is..... rainbows!!! When you look at a rainbow it just makes you realize how beautiful our world is and it just makes you want to smile due to the fascinating colorful arch. The garish colors gives you this feeling inside that relaxes your heart and makes you say.....”wow”. I don’t think that there is anything else (that I have seen) that is as beautiful or pleasing than a rainbow. _________ Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,technology
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/24/world/europe/isis-barcelona-attack.html,Cell Behind Barcelona Attack May Have Had Sights on Eiffel Tower Advertisement Supported by None In the weeks before they carried out an attack in the Spanish city of Barcelona last summer  a cell of jihadists inspired by the Islamic State traveled repeatedly to France  where they bought a camera and recorded footage of the Eiffel Tower. None None None None None None Investigators estimate that the terrorist cell had enough precursor chemicals to make 200 to 250 kilograms  or 440 to 550 pounds  of TATP  according to the study. None The Barcelona cell bought most of the ingredients for its homemade bombs on Aug. 1  2 and 16  the study found. The two vans used in the attacks were rented on Aug. 16 for seven days  suggesting that the group planned to commit the attack that week. In the rubble of the property in Alcanar  investigators recovered a notebook inscribed with the name of Abdelbaki Es Satty  the oldest member of the cell and its presumed ringleader and recruiter. In a sheet inside the notebook  they found a handwritten note in Arabic describing the cell members as “soldiers of the Islamic State in the land of al-Andalus ” the term the militant group uses to refer to the Iberian Peninsula. Within hours of the first attack  and again after the second  Islamic State’s news agency  Amaq  claimed credit  describing the attackers as “soldiers of the Islamic State.” The claim was repeated and amplified in numerous other ISIS media outlets  including their online magazine. None None Two other members of the Barcelona cell made an unexplained trip to Zurich in December 2016  and approximately a week before the attack  another member of the group  Driss Oukabir  made a nine-day trip to Morocco. When questioned  his relatives said they had found it odd that he did not stop by to see his father. The reasons for the trips remain unclear and they raise the possibility that one or more of the members of the cell traveled to make contact with ISIS operatives  the researchers say. What is known is that  during a trip to Paris  the cell members purchased a video camera and used it to film the Eiffel Tower. The same video  which was recovered in the debris  also shows Mohamed Hichamy  one of the members of the cell  standing in the safe house  holding TATP and saying  “Spaniards  you are going to suffer.” In addition to the footage of the Eiffel Tower  a cellphone used by a member of the cell included searches on Google Maps for several locations in Spain  including the Sagrada Familia church in Barcelona and the Camp Nou soccer stadium  suggesting that these monuments might also have been targets. Spanish officials told their French counterparts that they had recovered the footage of the Eiffel Tower soon after the Barcelona attack last fall. According to the researchers  the French government determined that the cell may have intended to strike Paris  too  where the city recently decided to install a glass fence around the Eiffel Tower  in an effort to protect the landmark from small-arms and vehicular attacks.

https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/08/health/ap-us-med-crowdfunding-medical-care.html,"Duped Patients Crowdfund for Bogus Medical Care  Study Says Advertisement Supported by None CHICAGO — They're the tech-age version of donor jars at the diner: crowdfunding websites that aim to link ailing people with strangers willing to help pay for medical treatment. But new research suggests duped patients sometimes crowdfund to pay for bogus stem cell treatments. A study published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association focused on for-profit clinics that use direct-to-consumer advertising for costly unproven stem-cell treatments for conditions including chronic lung disease  Parkinson's disease  multiple sclerosis and arthritis. Treatments are often marketed as cures or with a promise for vastly improved health. Patients who believe the hype sometimes turn to crowdfunding websites when their health insurance won't pay. The study looked at GoFundMe  one of the most popular online sites for personal fundraising  and YouCaring  a similar site that GoFundMe acquired last month. Over four months last year  the researchers found 408 pleas involving stem cell treatment that got pledges for nearly $1.5 million from 13 050 donors. Most of the campaigns echoed the companies' claims  inadvertently spreading potentially misleading messages  the researchers said. Some clinics encourage patients to use crowdfunding  and crowdfunding sites recommend sharing pleas on social media to help raise funds  said study lead author Jeremy Snyder  a bioethicist at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby  British Columbia. Their often desperate personal stories give clinics an additional advertising boost  he said. The study didn't examine how many patients eventually underwent stem cell treatment or how those who did fared  but deaths and permanent injury including blindness from unproven stem cell treatments have been reported. The study highlights a phenomenon that has gotten little attention  and Snyder said he was ""surprised by the scope of it."" ""There's no blame for the individuals. They're kind of trapped "" he said. ""They want to believe a lot of the times that this is going to really cure me. It's absolutely a heartbreaking situation."" Part of the problem is clinics that manage to skirt regulatory scrutiny  Snyder said. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has the authority to regulate stem cell products and pledged last year to crack down on doctors selling risky  unproven treatments. Stem cells have the ability to reproduce and to regenerate tissue. They are being studied as a potential way to treat many diseases but are approved in only a few medical procedures  including stem cells from donor bone marrow to treat leukemia and other blood diseases. The study highlights treatments that involve taking stem cells from patients' own fat or blood  processing them in the lab and returning them to the body via injection or infusion. Pete Canfield  of Spokane  Washington  has an incurable lung condition called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He said he read up on blood stem cell treatments offered by the Lung Institute  a Scottsdale  Arizona clinic  and believed claims that they would ease his breathing difficulties. He waged a GoFundMe campaign seeking $10 000 when his health insurer refused to pay  writing that the treatment ""has the potential to add several years to my life."" He raised $1 050  mostly from relatives. Canfield  65  said he maxed out his credit card to cover the rest  and had the treatment in April 2017. He said blood was withdrawn from an arm  processed somehow and re-injected back into the same arm. ""They claim that when they insert the stem cells they will automatically go to the organ that needs it the most "" Canfield said. ""I was a little skeptical of that part of the claim  but I'm not a scientist."" He ended up being unimpressed by the results. ""I don't think it did anything to improve my physical well-being "" he said. Canfield said his disease has since worsened and he now uses an oxygen machine nearly round-the-clock. He declined the clinic's offer to do a second procedure  saying  ""I'm not going to waste my money or my time."" The Lung Institute did not respond to several phone and email requests for comment. Cade Hildreth  president of Bioinformant.com  a market research firm that specializes in the stem cell industry  said that while ""there are undoubtedly stem cell providers that under-emphasize risks and exaggerate the efficacy of stem cell interventions "" the study overlooks treatments that have shown promise and a good patient-safety track record. In a written statement  GoFundMe said it removes any campaigns that violate the site's service terms but that it allows pleas for funding medical treatment that is experimental and part of legitimate research. The company says it refunds donors if misuse is detected. GoFundMe campaigns have raised more than $5 billion since the site launched in 2010. More than one-third of money raised last year went to medical campaigns. Adrienne Gonzales  a writer who started the GoFraudMe Facebook page and website after reading about scammers using GoFundMe to fleece donors  said crowdfunding serves an important purpose but that ""it's kind of the wild west out there."" Requiring patients to provide a verification letter from their doctors would be unfair  but ""at the same time these are people asking the whole internet for money "" she said. Dr. Jeremy Sugarman  a Johns Hopkins University bioethicist  said crowdfunding sites might be able to help rein in some of the problem by recommending that patients and families seeking funds consult with their doctors about treatment claims  or refer them to other reputable resources. Sugarman works with the ethics and policy committees at the International Society for Stem Cell Research  which offers online guidance for patients considering stem cell treatment  including: —What are the possible benefits? What are the risks? —What is the scientific evidence that the procedure will work? —How many people have gotten better from this treatment and how many haven't? ___ Follow AP Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner on Twitter at @LindseyTanner .

https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/09/us/ap-us-government-searches-electronic-devices.html,"Court Says Border Agents Need Suspicion to Search Cellphones Advertisement Supported by None RICHMOND  Va. — U.S. border authorities cannot search the cellphones of travelers without having some reason to believe a particular traveler has committed a crime  a federal appeals court ruled Wednesday. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond ruled in the case of a Turkish national who was arrested at Dulles International Airport after agents found firearm parts in his luggage. A lower court judge refused to suppress evidence obtained from a warrantless search of Hamza Kolsuz's phone. The 4th Circuit upheld that ruling and found that a forensic search of electronic devices requires ""individualized suspicion"" of wrongdoing. The court said agents had that suspicion because Kolsuz had made two previous attempts to smuggle weapons parts out of the U.S. The Fourth Amendment requires law enforcement to obtain warrants based on probable cause. But courts have made an exception for searches at airports and U.S. ports of entry  finding that the government can conduct warrantless border searches to protect national security  prevent transnational crime and enforce immigration and customs laws. The American Civil Liberties had urged the 4th Circuit to find that the government should be required to obtain a warrant or at least a determination of probable cause that evidence of a crime is contained on electronic devices before agents can search them at airports. The 4th Circuit said it did not have to reach the question of whether probable cause or a warrant is required. Reasonable suspicion is a lower legal standard. Claire Gastanaga  the executive director of the ACLU of Virginia  said the group is pleased that the appeals court ""recognized correctly that border agents can't conduct invasive searches on a traveler's cell phone or other electronic devices just because the person is crossing the border."" Last year  the ACLU filed a federal lawsuit claiming warrantless border searches are unconstitutional because of the vast amount of private personal and business information stored on electronic devices. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of 10 American citizens and a lawful permanent resident who all had their electronic devices searched by border agents when they returned from trips abroad. None of them had ever been accused of any wrongdoing. Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ",technology

https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/08/technology/ap-us-tec-google-showcase-the-latest.html,"The Latest: Some Android Features Not Coming to Samsung Advertisement Supported by None MOUNTAIN VIEW  Calif. — The Latest on Google's at its annual developers conference (all times local): 12:05 p.m. Some of the features Google is announcing at its annual developers conference won't be coming to Samsung phones. Google and Samsung have increasingly become competitors as Samsung launches services that duplicate what Google already offers on Android. Google is making a test version of the upcoming Android P operating system available on some phones  but none are from Samsung  the leading maker of Android phones. Samsung owners will have to wait several months for a later version. The new system promises better battery life and brightness adjustments with the help of artificial intelligence. Likewise  Samsung's camera app won't get a built-in Lens feature that lets Google offer information after taking a photo of a building or sign. Samsung has been developing its own  Bixby Vision. It's not immediately known which company made the call to withhold the features announced Tuesday. ___ 11:45 a.m. Google is introducing a navigation system feature with its Google Maps app that uses augmented reality to help guide people to their destination. When Google Maps users pull up directions  they can look through their camera in Maps and get turn-by-turn directions while viewing the actual street. The app will also orient users and verify their position using local landmarks such as buildings and shops viewed through the camera. Google says the technology is called VPS  or visual positioning system. It was unveiled Tuesday at the company's annual developers conference in Mountain View  California. ___ 11:25 a.m. Google outlined its latest improvements to its Android operating system  including more adaptive brightness settings and battery function. Called Android P it's the ninth major version of the Android operating system. The battery will now use machine learning to adapt to how you use apps in order to conserve energy and have what Dave Burke  Android vice president of engineering  calls a more ""consistent"" battery experience. It will also have something called ""adaptive brightness"" that learns how bright a user likes their screen based on manual adjustments  instead of automatically adjusting based on the how bright it is in the environment. Another feature called ""shush"" mode automatically turns on the ""Do Not Disturb"" function if someone turns their phone face down on a table. And ""Wind Down Mode"" will fade the screen to greyscale at a designated bed time to help users disconnect before bed. The features were discussed Tuesday at Google's annual developers conference. ___ 11:05 a.m. Google is working on technology it's calling Google Duplex that will use artificial intelligence to call businesses to make appointments and other tedious calls. In two demonstrations  one setting up a hair appointment and another a restaurant reservation  a realistic-sounding automated voice used pauses and ""ums"" and ""mmm-hmms"" to sound more human during interactions with people. ""Hi  I'm calling to book hair appointment for a client "" the AI voice said in the demo and then negotiated a time and date for the appointment. At its annual developers conference Tuesday  Google emphasized the technology is still in development and rolling out as ""an experiment"" in coming weeks. ""We really want to work hard to get this right "" CEO Sundar Pichai said. ___ 10:30 a.m. Google is introducing an autocomplete feature in its Gmail email service. The feature called ""smart compose"" uses machine learning to offer suggested ways to finish sentences users start typing. For example  ""I haven't seen you"" might be autocompleted to ""I haven't seen you in a while and I hope you're doing well."" Users can accept the completion by hitting tab. The ""smart compose"" feature that was introduced Tuesday at Google's annual developers conference should be available to all users this month. For its photos service  Google is starting a new service called ""Suggested Actions."" If it recognizes a photo of someone who is a Google contact  it can suggested sending it to the person.

https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/07/technology/07reuters-alphabet-google-android.html,"Google Launches Android Things for Appliances as Earlier Spinoffs Scramble to Catch On Advertisement Supported by None SAN FRANCISCO — Alphabet Inc's Google on Monday launched a spinoff of its Android operating system for home appliances and other machines  following mixed results with Android offshoots for cars  smartwatches and televisions. 'Android Things'  which arrives as Google opens its annual conference for developers  could bring its Google Assistant virtual helper to refrigerators and robots and familiar designs to cash registers and vending machines. ""The goal is to enable them to be built faster  cheaper and more secure "" said Venkat Rapaka  a product management director at Google.  Android derivatives aim to provide users with a consistent interface across devices  while Google and its business partners benefit from a standard way to distribute their applications. Though Google does not charge hardware manufacturers for Android  it expects to generate a return as consumers use new gadgets to use search  watch videos on YouTube and buy content from its Play Store. The Android operating system powers many of the world's smartphones and drives consumers to Google's cash-minting apps. But Google has struggled to extend Android's dominance into other areas over the last four years  technology and financial analysts said. ""If you're charitable  you say it's early "" said Richard Kramer of Arete Research. ""If you're not  you say Android is irrelevant outside phones."" Android Automotive is not yet deeply embedded in any cars. Shipments of smartwatches with Google's Wear OS were outnumbered five-to-one by rival Apple Inc devices last year  according to research firm IDC. Four times as many smart TV shipments last year had Samsung's operating system as Android TV  according to IHS Markit. In each category  Google's Android system posted less market share last year than manufacturer-customized Android variants  which are less fruitful for Google because they typically are not pre-loaded or compatible with its apps. Android variants thrive in China  where Google does not operate.  Google also has been slowed by resistance from carmakers to hand over a key interface  smartwatches from consumer electronics brands that failed to attract mass appeal and TV software that manufacturers found too rigid  analysts said. Google officials said the spinoffs have momentum. Activations of Wear OS devices rose 70 percent late last year compared to the year-earlier period. Android TV activations doubled last year compared to the year before  while vehicles with Android embedded should arrive next year  company officials told Reuters. South Asia and Latin America are bright spots  they said. Android TV had ""tremendous traction over the last year"" from Asian cable and satellite operators seeking it for set-top boxes  said Google product management director Shalini Govil-Pai.  Android Automotive was gaining attention from Indian automakers and from Brazil  said Patrick Brady  a Google engineering vice president.  Android Things competes with Amazon.com Inc's Greengrass system and Microsoft's Windows IoT.  Google says it will guarantee three years of free security patches to hardware makers and paid extended options. It is also considering automated security scans of device makers' apps. Health technology startup Byteflies  an Android Things tester  said it viewed the system's optional integration with Google's cloud computing service and the large Android developer community as big advantages.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/technology/lebanese-intelligence-spy-android-phones.html,Lebanese Intelligence Turned Targets’ Android Phones Into Spy Devices  Researchers Say Advertisement Supported by None None The spy operation  revealed on Thursday  is among dozens around the world uncovered by human rights groups and technical organizations in recent years as governments and intelligence agencies have started relying more on mobile and desktop spyware than on traditional forms of cloak-and-dagger espionage. The researchers found what they said was evidence that Lebanon’s intelligence agency — called General Directorate of General Security  or GDGS — spied on their targets’ Android mobile devices and desktop computers using various methods for more than six years. Their primary attack method  researchers said  was through a series of decoy Android apps designed to look like widely used private  secure messaging services such as WhatsApp and Signal. Once downloaded  the apps allowed spies to steal nearly everything off their victims’ phones  including text messages with one-time passcodes for accessing email and other services  as well as contact lists  call logs  browsing history  audio recordings and photos. The apps also let the spies take photos using the phone’s front or back camera  and turned the device into a silent microphone to capture audio. The apps were not designed to target Apple iPhone users. “One of the main takeaways from this investigation is that actors  like Dark Caracal  are shifting away from a pure desktop capability for espionage to now relying heavily on mobile tools to gather their intelligence ” said Michael Flossman  a security analyst at Lookout  referring to the name that he and other researchers coined for the Lebanese spies they said were most likely responsible for the espionage. GDGS is Lebanon’s main internal intelligence agency  and its director  Maj. Gen. Abbas Ibrahim  a career army general  has a rising profile and a broadening portfolio. The agency oversees residency permits for foreigners  from diplomats and tens of thousands of Southeast Asian domestic workers to more than a million Syrian refugees. The agency’s expertise and clout has traditionally been seen as stemming from its human intelligence  not from high-tech espionage techniques. Speaking ahead of the report’s publication  General Ibrahim told Reuters: “General Security does not have these type of capabilities. We wish we had these capabilities.” GDGS did not return a call for comment on Thursday. None Together  researchers tracked the spying to command and control servers operated by the attackers. The researchers looked at who had registered the servers and when  as well as the dates of some of the stolen content. They deduced that the campaign had been going on for as long as six years. The attackers were targeting journalists and activists  as well as government officials  military personnel  financial institutions  defense contractors and others in 21 countries. Those countries included the United States  China  Germany  India  Russia  Saudi Arabia  South Korea and inside Lebanon. The researchers traced the attacks to a building in Beirut that houses Lebanon’s GDGS  using Wi-Fi networks and so-called internet protocol addresses assigned to attackers’ machines. While researchers said they could not be sure whether the attacks were the work of the GDGS or rogue employees  many of the attacks appeared tied to an email address — op13@mail.com — that had been linked to various online personas  including “Nancy Razzouk” and “Rami Jabbour.” All of the physical addresses listed with registrations made by that email account were clustered around the GDGS building in Beirut  according to the user’s wireless activity. Emails sent to that email address were not returned. As part of their work  researchers found evidence that Lebanese spies were directing victims to install the spy apps through WhatsApp messages that began innocuously with a “How are you?” Those then linked to the spy apps with additional messages like “You can download from here to communicate further.” In other cases  the spies found their targets on Facebook  inviting them to Facebook groups  where they posted links to their decoy apps  which they often referred to by names like “WhatsApp plus.” The spies also directed victims to fake login sites for social media services like Twitter and Facebook to steal their credentials  hijack their accounts and push out trick messages to more people. Researchers also found evidence that Lebanese officials had previously used FinFisher  a product manufactured by the British company Gamma International  which sells surveillance tools that let customers turn computers and phones into listening devices to monitor a target’s messages  calls and whereabouts. Increasingly  researchers discovered that the spies had built their own custom mobile spy tools that were less sophisticated than FinFisher but as effective in getting the intelligence they were after. None Researchers also uncovered evidence that Lebanese officials deployed several variants of malware to victims’ desktop machines  the malware was designed to work across several operating systems  including Microsoft Windows  Apple’s Mac and Linux. That malware could steal screenshots of victims’ computer screens  use the victim’s webcam to spy on their physical whereabouts  record sound  grab photos and any Skype activity  file listings and files  and even iPhone backups. In the hours after researchers published their report on Thursday  the servers conducting the spying went dark. Anne Barnard contributed reporting.

She’s the perfect partner. We communicate well and love each other. In spite of this  I’m plagued by a bizarre  irrational and retroactive jealousy of her past relationships. We’re both women. She’s bisexual  I’m gay. We’ve been a couple twice — once when we dated for a few months before breaking up because of distance  and now this second time. She’s had two other relationships: one with a man she dated for a year while we were friends and before she was out  the other with a man she was with during the time after we broke up and before we got back together.  I fixate on these relationships and I feel insecure and possessive of her  even though rationally I know there’s is nothing wrong with her having dated other people. I’ve fallen into destructive habits like searching her Instagram for old photos of her with her previous boyfriends  thinking about how they might have been better than me  how she must have cared for them and imagining the sexual things they did together. I feel miserable when I have these thoughts  but I indulge them anyway. My problem is exacerbated by the fact that she’s the only person I’ve ever been involved with romantically or sexually — no one besides her has even shown interest — so in addition to feeling jealous of her past relationships  I’m also jealous that she’s had normal romantic experiences. I feel incredibly inferior in comparison to her. I know that logically speaking  my feelings are silly. I want to enjoy our relationship and let go of the past. But how? I’ve talked to my partner about my struggles and she reassures me  but soon I’m back in my self-destructive spiral. I can’t seem to get over it and I fear it’s going to destroy us. Jealous None So focus your energies there. You feel anxious and insecure in this relationship because in this relationship you are anxious and insecure. Why? What are your models for intimate relationships and how have they shaped your perceptions about what it means to have a romantic partnership? Answering these and other questions in a deep and meaningful way is far more important than figuring out how you might force yourself to refrain from looking at your girlfriend’s old Instagram photos. In fact  doing so is likely the only way you’ll ever stop. None None None The hours you spend thinking about the people your partner used to date is a way of keeping your love for each other at arm’s length. Perhaps beneath your worry that your girlfriend was happier with her exes than she is with you  there’s an unconscious wish. One that will keep you safe — or at least believing you are. Maybe that’s also the reason you’ve only recently begun having “normal” romantic experiences. A good therapist will help you explore that. None But cutting beneath your specific doubts is the universal truth Cheryl identified: that you may be undermining this love to keep yourself safe from heartbreak. We all do this  to some degree  in relationships that place us at risk — we unconsciously engineer bad outcomes. It’s how we seize control of dynamics that often feel out of control. But there’s a better way. Working with a therapist will allow you to understand the meaning of your jealousy  which will diminish its power. Remember the big picture here: You deserve love and happiness. It may take some work to fully accept this  Jealous. But you’re on the right path. Nobody writes a letter as honest and vulnerable as yours unless they’re brave as hell. Keep going. None None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,technology

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/opinion/apple-tax-cuts.html,Apple and the Fruits of Tax Cuts Advertisement Supported by None Opinion Columnist None None But they have a problem: Public perceptions about who benefits from the tax cut  and who doesn’t  are accurate  a point Apple just nicely demonstrated with its announcement of a huge stock buyback. To be fair  the notion that a big tax cut for corporations — which was the main element of last year’s law — might eventually redound to the benefit of workers isn’t crazy. But the two key words here are “might” and “eventually.” The story tax-cut boosters tell runs as follows: America is part of a global capital market in which capital flows wherever it yields the highest after-tax rate of return. By cutting taxes on corporations  Trump and his allies have given corporations an incentive to invest here. Investment will expand capacity  driving up the demand for workers and thus lead to higher wages. None But what does “bringing money to America” mean? Apple didn’t have a huge  Scrooge McDuck-style pile of gold sitting in Ireland  which it loaded onto a homeward-bound ship. It has digital claims — a bunch of zeros and ones on some server somewhere — which in effect used to bear a label saying “this money is in Ireland.” Now it has changed the label to say “this money is in America.” What difference does this make? Well  it alters the company’s tax liabilities to the U.S. and Irish governments  which was the point of the change. But otherwise it makes no difference at all. None None But why aren’t the benefits of the tax cut flowing to workers? One answer is that even if the pro-tax-cut story were true for the long run  it would take many years of extremely high investment to achieve the kind of capacity expansion that would cause major wage gains. Another is that the global capital market isn’t as global as all that — the investment world  we might say  is still a long way from being flat. America is a huge economy  and even in the long run it can’t attract the kind of capital inflows tax-cut enthusiasts envision without offering significantly higher rates of return — which means more for stockholders and less for workers. And at a deeper level  tax-cut enthusiasts may have a fundamentally out-of-date view about where profits come from. None Apple  however  is nothing like that. Its profits come from its market position — its brand  if you like. It doesn’t matter whether you think it deserves its role as a quasi-monopolist  what matters is that given its position  it can and does charge what the market will bear  pretty much regardless of costs. If Trump cuts its taxes  it gets to keep more of its profits  but it has no real incentive to change its behavior by  say  building more Apple stores. It just takes the extra money and either sits on it or hands it back to stockholders via buybacks. And these days a lot of corporate America is at least a bit like Apple. Not all of it  there are still businesses — say  trucking companies — whose value resides largely in the stuff they own. But economic “rents ” profits not tied to physical capital  are a big  growing story. And when you cut taxes on rents  there’s no reason at all to expect workers to share the bounty  even in the long run. The bottom line — which will remain true no matter how much the Kochs spend trying to convince you otherwise — is that what looks like a big giveaway to wealthy investors is  in fact  a big giveaway to wealthy investors.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/technology/apple-stock-buyback-earnings.html,Apple Says It Will Buy Back $100 Billion in Stock Advertisement Supported by None None Apple said it would buy back an additional $100 billion in stock  by far the largest increase in its already historic record of returning capital to investors. The company didn’t provide a timeline for the repurchases. Apple also increased its dividend by 16 percent to 73 cents a share  pushing past Exxon Mobil to become the largest dividend payer  according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. None But critics say the actions can take money away from potential investments in hiring or research and development  and can increase economic inequality because they typically benefit wealthier people. Investors should want companies to reinvest in themselves and their employees versus repurchasing their own stock to increase the share price  said William Lazonick  an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts  Lowell  who studies stock buybacks. “It’s nothing but a manipulation of the stock market.” Luca Maestri  Apple’s chief financial officer  said in an interview that Apple was making significant investments in hiring  research and development  and manufacturing  “but we also have a very  very profitable business.” He said that “because we’re making all the right investments all around the company  it makes perfect sense for us not to keep the cash on our balance sheet but return it to investors.” No company has ever done stock buybacks like Apple. In the most recent quarter  Apple repurchased $23.5 billion in stock — the largest single stock buyback ever and more than the market value of 275 of the companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index  said Howard Silverblatt  a senior index analyst with S&P Dow Jones Indices. Apple said Tuesday that it had now returned $275 billion to shareholders since 2012 and that it planned to finish its previous stock-buyback program in the current quarter  about nine months early. None Other academics and investors cheered Apple’s continued returns to shareholders. “People like to believe the stories that C.E.O.s do things to boost the short-term stock price and line their own pockets ” said Alex Edmans  a finance professor at the London Business School. “But if you look at hundreds of examples  you find that stock buybacks do increase long-term value.” He said that companies typically bought back stock only when they had extra cash that they would not reinvest otherwise  and that investors would spend that money elsewhere. Apple said its profit increased 25 percent to $13.8 billion in the most recent quarter on the back of strong revenue growth for iPhones  the Apple Watch and its services business. Apple earned $2.73 a share  it said  beating Wall Street estimates by 6 cents. Revenue rose 16 percent to $61.1 billion. The three months ending with March were Apple’s first full quarter selling its new flagship phone  the iPhone X. Analysts had pointed to signs  including the financial results of Apple’s suppliers  that the device and its sister iPhone 8 and 8 Plus had not revitalized Apple’s iPhone business as the company had hoped. Many analysts lowered their estimates for Apple in recent weeks as a result. Apple said it sold 52.2 million iPhones in the quarter  or 3 percent more than a year earlier. But an 11 percent increase in their average price — driven by the $1 000 iPhone X — helped raise iPhone revenue by 14 percent. Timothy D. Cook  Apple’s chief executive  hit back at the notion that the iPhone business  which accounts for 62 percent of the company’s overall revenue  had little room to grow. “I don’t buy the view that the market is saturated ” he said. Investors have also worried that Apple’s influence in China  the company’s No. 2 market  is waning amid stronger competition from Chinese rivals. But Apple’s results suggest that Chinese consumers are willing to pay for the pricier iPhones. Apple said revenue in mainland China  Taiwan and Hong Kong had risen 21 percent to $13 billion  the largest increase in 10 quarters. And Apple’s services revenue  which includes iCloud and Apple Music subscriptions and its share of app sales  rose 31 percent to $9.2 billion. Apple said consumers had paid for more than 270 million subscriptions for its services or ones sold via its App Store  up from roughly 170 million a year earlier.

The other is a financial powerhouse with few offerings for everyday consumers. Now they’re trying to join forces. Apple and Goldman Sachs have been working for months on a new credit card product that would bear the Apple Pay brand  according to two people familiar with the companies’ talks. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were continuing. The product would be Goldman’s first credit card offering and could help the bank’s effort to expand its consumer products. For Apple  the deal could help it extend its Apple Pay brand  the technology giant’s digital payment service. The two companies have been talking for months and haven’t settled on all the details  said one of the people. Andrew Williams  a spokesman for Goldman Sachs  declined to comment. Christine Monaghan  an Apple spokeswoman  also declined to comment. None The new card would fit into the suite of consumer products that Goldman recently began offering  like a savings account and an array of personal loans through its consumer banking service  Marcus. Goldman hopes to use those new products to reduce its reliance on trading revenue in the years to come. The card could help Goldman insert itself into the lives of iPhone users  who represent a far broader swath of consumers than the company now serves  and eventually open them up to the other services the bank has to offer. “This seems to make sense ” said Devin Ryan  an analyst at JMP Securities  “It’s just one piece of a much bigger puzzle that is forming that is Goldman Sachs’s consumer finance business.” Part of Goldman’s recent consumer buildup has focused on credit cards. In December  the bank hired a team from a credit card start-up called Final. In April it bought a mobile app  Clarity Money  that helps users search for the best credit card deals. It has been downloaded a million times. Apple already has one branded credit card  offered by Barclays. That card allows users to earn points they can use for Apple gift cards or for financing the purchase of new Apple products. None Apple executives have said they aim for Apple Pay to eventually replace cash and plastic as the primary way to pay. But Apple’s payment service has a long way to go. One of the people familiar with the discussions between Apple and Goldman said that taking Apple Pay into the physical world would help expand its reach. With an Apple Pay credit card  loyal iPhone users could use Apple Pay even in places that don’t yet accept digital payments  the person said. None None “It’s such a competitive credit card marketplace right now  especially for higher end folks ” said Matt Schulz  a CreditCards.com analyst. “The Apple Barclays card isn’t anything that’s going to turn that person’s head  in terms of making them want to get a card.

https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/06/business/06reuters-apple-stock.html,Apple and Buffett Saw Value  and Acted Advertisement Supported by None SAN FRANCISCO — Apple Inc was not the only one to leap on a chance to buy its stock at a fat discount last quarter as Warren Buffett stepped in to scoop up an additional 75 million shares for Berkshire Hathaway at the same time. Between them - the two biggest players in the iPhone maker's shares - they bought nearly one of every 10 Apple shares traded during the quarter  according to Thomson Reuters calculations. But the discount window did not stay open long  with Apple's stock back at a record high above $183 on Friday after trading in the mid-$150s for part of the first quarter.  The recovery in the share prices makes it less opportune for Apple's corporate treasury to execute purchases as it proceeds with an additional $100 billion of buybacks in an effort to further winnow down its mountain of cash. Apple bought more than $23 billion of its own shares in the first three months of the year at an average price of $171.48  the company said this week. A Buffett representative on Friday confirmed Berkshire Hathaway increased its stake in Apple by 75 million shares  for which the company looks to have paid between $12 billion and $13 billion  based on the stock's trading range during the period. Funds from the repatriation of Apple's $252 billion overseas cash hoard arrived at an convenient time for traders working on behalf of Apple. The Cupertino  California  company's massive share purchase in the March quarter coincided with a 10 percent slump in the S&P 500 between Jan 26 and Feb 8.  That drop raised fears across Wall Street that a nine-year bull market was ending and made it easier for big players amassing shares in a company to find willing sellers.  Apple shares fell even more than the broader market  tumbling over 13 percent from their record high close. But while the S&P 500 has remained in correction territory  Apple shares quickly recovered  and it seems the company and Berkshire were there to help.  Buffett  a billionaire bargain hunter  increased his company's stake to 240.3 million shares worth $42.5 billion during first quarter. At its low in February  the stock was available for as little as $150  an 18 percent discount to its current price. On more than a third of the trading days during the March quarter  Apple's stock traded below its volume weighted average price  or VWAP  for the prior 60 days.  On Feb 8  when it closed at $155.15  the low for the quarter  it was at a nearly 10 percent discount from its 60-day average VWAP. The stock had not been available at such a large discount to its prevailing average since May 2016  which happens to be when Buffett bought his first-ever shares of Apple. At its close of $183.83 on Friday  however  Apple now stands at a premium of nearly 7 percent to its 60-day VWAP of $172.11. Prior to last quarter  Apple's largest-ever quarterly repurchase occurred in early 2014  a year after it initiated its first $210 billion buyback program. The stock traded at a discount to its 60-day VWAP through much of the quarter  and Apple spent $18 billion to buy up its own shares  according to filings.

The device costs $299 for schools and $329 for consumers  the same price as its previous version  and the Apple Pencil was priced at $89 for schools. The company also increased the amount of cloud storage for students to 200 gigabytes  from 5 gigabytes. In addition  Apple announced new software for the classroom. That includes Schoolwork  an app for teachers to create and track assignments  and updates to its productivity apps for education. The company also showed off a curriculum called Everyone Can Create that helps teach students skills in music  video  photography and art. “Our place at the intersection of technology and the liberal arts makes it possible for us to create powerful products and tools that amplify learning and creativity ” said Timothy D. Cook  Apple’s chief executive  at an event in the auditorium of Lane Technical College Prep High School on Chicago’s North Side. Apple  Google and Microsoft are each aiming to accustom schoolchildren to their operating systems to win the next generation as lifelong customers. Even Amazon got in on the act on Tuesday  announcing a plan to give students access to resources in its Amazon Web Services cloud network. “These companies know that it’s very important to build mind share at a very early age ” said Linn Huang  a research director at the International Data Corporation  a market research firm known as IDC. None Of the 12.4 million tablets and laptops shipped to primary and secondary schools in the United States last year  Chromebooks accounted for 58 percent of the market  compared with a negligible share in 2012  according to IDC. In the same period  the share of iPads and Mac laptops fell to 22 percent from about half. And Microsoft Windows devices dropped to 18 percent from about 45 percent  IDC said. School districts embraced Chromebooks because they were comparatively inexpensive and easy to use. Since the laptops were cloud-based  they could be shared among students who could pick up any device to get access to their documents. And school districts could use a software dashboard to manage thousands of devices at once. Districts that needed to institute online testing began buying Chromebooks in bulk. Still  Apple generates the most revenue from school hardware sales in the United States  partly because its devices cost more. Of the $5.4 billion spent on school devices last year in the United States  Apple’s iPads and laptops accounted for about $2.1 billion  followed by Chromebooks at $1.95 billion and Microsoft Windows devices at $1.35 billion  according to IDC. Apple’s new iPad signals how the company sees an opening at the lower end of the market. Last year  it lowered the price of its entry-level iPad to $329 for consumers and $299 for schools  helping to bolster sales of iPads after years of declines. Some Chromebooks and Windows laptops cost less than $200. But as the American market for classroom devices matures and school districts prepare to replace the basic Chromebook laptops they purchased  analysts said Apple was well positioned to take advantage of growing interest among school districts for more sophisticated technologies that encourage student creativity in fields like robotics and computer-assisted design. “We’re starting to see an evolution of use cases around coding  STEM  creative arts and design  some of the areas where Apple is focused ” said Ben Davis  a senior analyst in education at Futuresource Consulting  a market research firm that tracks school device shipments. “In theory  we should start to see a trade-up in computing power in the devices going into schools to support that.” Apple’s event was atypical because it rarely goes outside its home state of California to make product announcements. But it opted for the backdrop of a Midwest high school to drive home its education message.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/business/apple-hires-googles-ai-chief.html,Apple Hires Google’s A.I. Chief Advertisement Supported by None SAN FRANCISCO — Apple has hired Google’s chief of search and artificial intelligence  John Giannandrea  a major coup in its bid to catch up to the artificial intelligence technology of its rivals. Apple said on Tuesday that Mr. Giannandrea will run Apple’s “machine learning and A.I. strategy ” and become one of 16 executives who report directly to Apple’s chief executive  Timothy D. Cook. The hire is a victory for Apple  which many Silicon Valley executives and analysts view as lagging its peers in artificial intelligence  an increasingly crucial technology for companies that enable computers to handle more complex tasks  like understanding voice commands or identifying people in images. “Our technology must be infused with the values we all hold dear ” Mr. Cook said Tuesday morning in an email to staff members obtained by The New York Times. “John shares our commitment to privacy and our thoughtful approach as we make computers even smarter and more personal.” While Apple has risen to become the world’s most valuable publicly traded company on the back of the iPhone  many in the technology industry consider the iPhone’s digital assistant  Siri  to be less effective than its counterparts at Google and Amazon. Mr. Giannandrea  a 53-year-old native of Scotland known to colleagues as J.G.  helped lead the push to integrate A.I. throughout Google’s products  including internet search  Gmail and its own digital assistant  Google Assistant. None None Apple has made other high-profile hires in the field  including the Carnegie Mellon professor Russ Salakhutdinov. Mr. Salakhutdinov studied at the University of Toronto under Geoffrey Hinton  who helps oversee the Google Brain lab. Apple has taken a strong stance on protecting the privacy of people who use its devices and online services  which could put it at a disadvantage when building services using neural networks. Researchers train these systems by pooling enormous amounts of digital data  sometimes from customer services. Apple  however  has said it is developing methods that would allow it to train these algorithms without compromising privacy. None “What I object to is this assumption that we will leap to some kind of superintelligent system that will then make humans obsolete ” he said. “I understand why people are concerned about it but I think it’s gotten way too much airtime.

The Goldman-Apple credit card would be tied to Apple's payment service known as Apple Pay and Apple's co-brand partnership with Barclays would come to an end  the Journal said. Goldman has been incrementally pushing into consumer banking products. It does personal loans and savings accounts under the brand Marcus  and has been looking at other consumer products. A co-brand credit card is when a company partners with a bank to create a credit card that will spur loyalty and spending with the company. There are hundreds of co-brand partnerships  with brands large and small  and it's an intensely competitive business for credit card companies. Apple is a huge and iconic brand  and it would be a symbolic success for Goldman as it enters the consumer credit card market  industry experts said  But it is not a large co-brand partnership like American Express' partnership with Delta Air Lines  Citigroup's partnerships with Costco and American Airlines or JPMorgan Chase's partnerships with Marriott and United. ""It's not going to put them on the map when it comes to market share  but it's definitely a strong customer base you want to have "" said Brian Riley with Mercator Advisory Group  which specializes in consulting with companies looking to do co-brand credit cards.

None None Laws in the United States restrict foreign entities from running election-related ads. The new policies pertain to advertisements featuring candidates for federal office or current office holders. The rules do not apply to candidates for state or local offices. The policies also do not apply to advertisements on politically charged issues — the types of topics that foreign agents used to sow division in the American electorate ahead of the 2016 elections. “As we learn from these changes and our continued engagement with leaders and experts in the field  we’ll work to improve transparency of political issue ads and expand our coverage to a wider range of elections ” Kent Walker  a Google senior vice president and general counsel  said in the post announcing the new policies. Google and Facebook  the two dominant forces in online advertising  are tightening guidelines for election ads as they brace for this fall’s midterm races. Politicians and regulators will be watching closely to see whether those technology platforms can be used again for misinformation campaigns. None Under its new policies  Google said political ads would include a disclosure about who is paying for them and that it planned to publish a transparency report focused on election ads. It will also create a database of election ads that includes information on funding sources and the amount of money spent.

Technology Advertisement Supported by None MOUNTAIN VIEW  Calif. — Google’s annual conference for software developers is usually a celebration of technology  an event that highlights how tech advancements — no matter how mundane — are good for the world. None “There are very real and important questions being raised about the impact of these advances  and the role they will play in our lives ” Mr. Pichai said during his keynote speech. “We know the path ahead needs to be navigated carefully and deliberately. We feel a deep sense of responsibility to get this right.” None None None It is the type of meaningful breakthrough that Google executives love to promote  but it has little to do with Google’s core web products or the way it makes money. But even those services are getting an artificially intelligent makeover. The company demonstrated how its Google Assistant computer software is now capable of calling a person at a hair salon or a restaurant to make a reservation. Google said artificial intelligence had allowed the computer’s voice to sound more human — complete with “uhs” and natural pauses  as well as logical follow-up questions — so the person at the other end does not know that he or she is speaking to a computer. Improvements in A.I. have allowed Google’s computer assistant to have different voices and accents  including the ability later this year to have the singer John Legend tell you the day’s weather. The company also demonstrated a new artificially intelligent feature in Gmail  called Smart Compose  that starts to suggest complete sentences in email as you type. Google said this would help users complete emails more quickly with fewer spelling and grammar mistakes. It plans to add this feature over the next few weeks. None None Mark Hung  a research vice president at the research firm Gartner  said the conference demonstrated how much Google relied on A.I. to make its products stand out. “Almost everything Google is announcing now is A.I. related ” he said. “Google has a lead on artificial intelligence over many of its competitors  and it’s going to use that as a weapon to advance their products forward.” In keeping with a theme of a more responsible Google  the company also introduced features aimed at addressing how technology is burrowing deeper into our lives — sometimes in negative ways. Google unveiled a series of “digital well-being” updates in the next version of its Android smartphone software. They include a timer that allows a person to limit time spent on certain apps each day and a Do Not Disturb feature that silences phone calls and notifications  and that can be turned on by placing the smartphone screen face down on a table.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/technology/google-letter-ceo-pentagon-project.html,‘The Business of War’: Google Employees Protest Work for the Pentagon Advertisement Supported by None WASHINGTON — Thousands of Google employees  including dozens of senior engineers  have signed a letter protesting the company’s involvement in a Pentagon program that uses artificial intelligence to interpret video imagery and could be used to improve the targeting of drone strikes. The letter  which is circulating inside Google and has garnered more than 3 100 signatures  reflects a culture clash between Silicon Valley and the federal government that is likely to intensify as cutting-edge artificial intelligence is increasingly employed for military purposes. None “We believe that Google should not be in the business of war ” says the letter  addressed to Sundar Pichai  the company’s chief executive. It asks that Google pull out of Project Maven  a Pentagon pilot program  and announce a policy that it will not “ever build warfare technology.” That kind of idealistic stance  while certainly not shared by all Google employees  comes naturally to a company whose motto is “Don’t be evil ” a phrase invoked in the protest letter. But it is distinctly foreign to Washington’s massive defense industry and certainly to the Pentagon  where the defense secretary  Jim Mattis  has often said a central goal is to increase the “lethality” of the United States military. None Google employees have circulated protest petitions on a range of issues  including Google Plus  the company’s lagging competitor to Facebook  and Google’s sponsorship of the Conservative Political Action Conference. Employees raised questions about Google’s involvement in Project Maven at a recent companywide meeting. At the time  Diane Greene  who leads Google’s cloud infrastructure business  defended the deal and sought to reassure concerned employees. A company spokesman said most of the signatures on the protest letter had been collected before the company had an opportunity to explain the situation. None But improved analysis of drone video could be used to pick out human targets for strikes  while also better identifying civilians to reduce the accidental killing of innocent people. Without referring directly to the letter to Mr. Pichai  Google said in a statement on Tuesday that “any military use of machine learning naturally raises valid concerns.” It added  “We’re actively engaged across the company in a comprehensive discussion of this important topic.” The company called such exchanges “hugely important and beneficial ” though several Google employees familiar with the letter would speak of it only on the condition of anonymity  saying they were concerned about retaliation. The statement said the company’s part of Project Maven was “specifically scoped to be for non-offensive purposes ” though officials declined to make available the relevant contract language. The Defense Department said that because Google is a subcontractor on Project Maven to the prime contractor  ECS Federal  it could not provide either the amount or the language of Google’s contract. ECS Federal did not respond to inquiries. Google said the Pentagon was using “open-source object recognition software available to any Google Cloud customer” and based on unclassified data. “The technology is used to flag images for human review and is intended to save lives and save people from having to do highly tedious work ” the company said. None None An uneasiness about military contracts among a small fraction of Google’s more than 70 000 employees may not pose a major obstacle to the company’s growth. But in the rarefied area of artificial intelligence research  Google is engaged in intense competition with other tech companies for the most talented people  so recruiters could be hampered if some candidates are put off by Google’s defense connections. None None None The employees’ protest letter to Mr. Pichai  which has been circulated on an internal communications system for several weeks  argues that embracing military work could backfire by alienating customers and potential recruits. “This plan will irreparably damage Google’s brand and its ability to compete for talent ” the letter says. “Amid growing fears of biased and weaponized AI  Google is already struggling to keep the public’s trust.” It suggests that Google risks being viewed as joining the ranks of big defense contractors like Raytheon  General Dynamics and the big-data firm Palantir. None Like other onetime upstarts turned powerful Silicon Valley behemoths  Google is being forced to confront the idealism that guided the company in its early years. Facebook started with the lofty mission of connecting people all over the world  but it has recently come under fire for becoming a conduit for fake news and being used by Russia to influence the 2016 election and sow dissent among American voters. Paul Scharre  a former Pentagon official and author of “Army of None ” a forthcoming book on the use of artificial intelligence to build autonomous weapons  said the clash inside Google was inevitable  given the company’s history and the booming demand for A.I. in the military. “There’s a strong libertarian ethos among tech folks  and a wariness about the government’s use of technology ” said Mr. Scharre  a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security in Washington. “Now A.I. is suddenly and quite quickly moving out of the research lab and into real life.” Scott Shane reported from Washington  and Daisuke Wakabayashi from San Francisco.

Google’s campaign  which was announced at an event in New York on Tuesday  will be known as the Google News Initiative. Among the initiative’s goals are making it easier for Google users to subscribe to news publications  and giving publishers new tools to create fast-loading mobile pages. The project is Google’s most ambitious attempt yet to improve the quality of information it shows to users at a time when tech companies have come under criticism for letting hoaxes and misinformation bloom on their services. None None Richard Gingras  Google’s vice president of news products  said the company had built new tools  including some already in operation  to prevent malicious actors from gaming its search algorithms to spread disinformation. He pointed to the search results for the shooting at a Maryland high school earlier Tuesday. Unlike the search results for similar previous shootings  which surfaced stories from hoax websites and toxic message boards  the results on both Google and YouTube for topics related to the Maryland shooting were dominated by stories from legitimate mainstream publications. “We want to make it easier for users to see the authoritative coverage up front ” Mr. Gingras said. None None Google didn’t unveil any specific plans to address synthetic media but said it would release data sets to journalism organizations and researchers to help them develop tools to spot the fakes. “This won’t solve the problem  but the more brains we put behind it  the more progress we can all make ” Mr. Gingras said.

The company said the ban also applied to content related to cryptocurrencies “including but not limited to initial coin offerings  cryptocurrency exchanges  cryptocurrency wallets and cryptocurrency trading advice.” None None In recent months  American regulators have made it clear that many of the coin offerings were most likely illegal.

https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/08/technology/ap-us-tec-google-showcase-highlights.html,"At a Glance: New Google Features Tap Digital Smarts Advertisement Supported by None MOUNTAIN VIEW  Calif. — Google showcased its plans for the next several months as it kicked off its annual developers' conference Tuesday. Many of the new features center on the use of artificial intelligence to help save time. Here are the highlights: ___ MAPS: Google will use augmented reality to help guide you to your destination. When you pull up direction on Google Maps  you can look through the camera and get turn-by-turn directions while viewing the actual street. The app will also orient you and verify your position using local landmarks such as buildings and shops viewed through the camera. Google calls the technology VPS  or visual positioning system. The feature is expected this summer. ___ GOOGLE DUPLEX: Google's digital assistant will call actual people at businesses to make restaurant reservations and hair appointments and check holiday hours. In two demonstrations  a realistic-sounding automated voice used pauses and ""ums"" and ""mmm-hmms"" to sound more human during interactions with people. Google says the technology is rolling out as ""an experiment"" in coming weeks. Google says it's still figuring out how to be upfront and let businesses know that they are talking to a computer. ___ GMAIL: An autocomplete feature called ""smart compose"" uses artificial intelligence to suggest ways to finish sentences you start typing. For example  ""I haven't seen you"" might be autocompleted to ""I haven't seen you in a while and I hope you're doing well."" The feature will start rolling out this month. ___ PHOTOS: When Google recognizes a photo of someone who is one of your contacts  it can suggest sending the photo to that person. It can also convert photos to PDFs and automatically add color to black-and-white photos or make part of a color photo black and white. The changes are coming in the next few months. ___ GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Google's digital assistant will get six new voices  including one based on that of singer John Legend  later this year. The voices aim to sound more natural and will include pauses that convey meaning. Google is also unveiling ways to let you issue multiple commands without having to say ""Hey Google"" each time. And it will reward kids who say ""please "" similar to a feature Amazon is bringing to its Alexa voice assistant. ___ LENS: Google's visual assistant will be built into the camera. Just point the camera at a building or sign to get more information. Or copy text from images of menus  documents and other sources into another app on your phone. Samsung phones aren't on the list of phones getting the feature starting next week. Samsung has its own version  Bixby Vision. ___ NEWS: Google is redesigning the News feature to present five stories you need to know  plus others that it thinks will be most relevant to you. For outlets with subscriptions  Google will allow you to subscribe directly through your Google account  without needing new passwords or credit card information. The feature should be available to everyone by next week. ___ ANDROID P: The version of Google's Android phone software will infuse basic functions with AI smarts. The battery will adapt to how you use apps in order to conserve energy. ""Adaptive brightness"" will learn how bright you like your screen based on manual adjustments  instead of automatically adjusting based on the how bright it is. Apple's latest system  iOS 11  has a similar feature. Owners of some Android phones — none from Samsung — can get an early test version now. ___ WELL-BEING: Android P also includes features to combat overuse. A ""shush"" mode automatically turns on the ""Do Not Disturb"" mode when you turn your phone face down on a table. And ""Wind Down Mode"" will fade the screen to greyscale at a designated bed time to help you disconnect before bed. Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ",technology

Our paper is known as “The Gray Lady ” a nickname she shares with several famous ghosts. Part of my job is to help keep her relevant to the world of the living. None I land somewhere between those two groups. I’m 32  and I’m neither a kid nor a parent. I try to strike a balance. I want my stories to be accessible to my most dedicated reader — my 89-year-old grandfather (Hi  Grandpa Jack!) — without turning away a 19-year-old reader who has never thought of The New York Times as a publication that’s particularly relevant to her. (Maybe because The Times has not always thought much about catering to her interests.) None Now that I’m here  I find that seemingly tiny details and tonal choices can have a big impact over how a story is perceived. There may yet be Times readers out there  for instance  who don’t know what #TBT stands for  and lack the internet-native reflex to just Google it. But if I explain what #TBT means in a piece  internet-savvy readers will see it as a big flashing sign that says: “THIS COLUMN ISN’T FOR YOU.” So I leave it be. None None Our working tagline  “Everything weird  wrong  and totally sad about internet culture ” partly reflects my pessimistic mood about the internet lately  but also signals our interest in conflict and argument. The best and scariest part of it is that this is all really new for The Times  and for me  too. Before this  I’d never made a video in my life. Now I’m acting as scriptwriter and voice-over artist and producer  though I’m still not quite sure what that is. My pal and confidant is the brilliant “Internetting” video editor Shane O’Neill  who also wrote and performs the series’ theme song. (I have a theme song!) As a words person  it’s been amazing to be able to collaborate with someone who thinks really deeply about the way things look and sound. And while it’s still a challenge to make something about the internet that might appeal to everybody on it  it’s helpful to be able to work on a couple of tracks at the same time. While the voice-over lays out an argumentative essay about the internet  the visuals situate the viewer in a place and time and layer in inside jokes and references.Whether we’re trying to shine light on some obscure corner of the internet  or to reframe a familiar one through a new perspective  it’s a revelation and a relief to be able to show rather than tell.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/10/magazine/cambridge-analytica-and-the-coming-data-bust.html,Cambridge Analytica and the Coming Data Bust Advertisement Supported by On Technology None The queasy truth at the heart of Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal  which is so far the company’s defining disgrace of 2018  is that its genesis became scandalous only in retrospect. The series of events that now implicate Facebook began in 2014  in plain view  with a listing on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk service  where users can complete small tasks for commensurately modest sums of cash. In exchange for installing a Facebook app and completing a survey — in the process granting the app access to parts of your Facebook profile — you would get around a dollar. Maybe two. This was a great deal  at least by the standards of the time. Facebook users were then accustomed to granting apps permission to see their personal data in exchange for much less. It was the tail end of a Facebook era defined by connected apps: games like FarmVille  Candy Crush and Words With Friends  apps that broadcast your extra-Facebook activities  like Spotify and Pinterest  and apps that were almost explicitly about gathering as much useful data as possible from users  like TripAdvisor’s Cities I’ve Visited app  which let you share a digital pushpin map with your friends. Most of these apps  when installed  demanded permission to access “your profile info ” which could include things like your activity  birthday  relationship status  interests  religious and political views  likes  education and work history. They could also collect information about users’ friends  multiplying their reach. In providing a marketplace for such apps  Facebook made it easy for users to extend their extraordinarily intimate relationship with the site to thousands of third-party developers. One of them turned out to be connected to Cambridge Analytica  which was using the data for right-wing political campaigns — a fact that was lucidly and widely reported as early as 2015 but promptly lost in the roiling insanity of primary season. (As of Facebook’s most recent admission  data was collected on as many as 87 million users.) Not that more exposure in the news cycle would have mattered much back then. It was self-evidently absurd to grant a virtual-farming game access to your religious views  but that’s just how the platform worked at the time  and so we got used to it  much in the same way we got used to conducting our private lives on any other corporate platform. (When Gmail first started in 2004  the fact that it placed ads based on the contents of users’ emails was considered invasive. That feeling passed  Google continued scanning consumer email until 2017  and Gmail now has more than a billion users.) Still  these individually trivial decisions never gave us cause to confront just how much we had come to trust Facebook. Whenever you sign up for any free service  you’re aware  in the loosest terms  that you’re giving up something. It usually includes a license to use the content you create — be it capital-C Content  like public posts  or things you would intuitively understand as more private  like your direct messages and which profiles you look at — however the service pleases. You could imagine the problem with all this  if asked: You’re giving up your privacy to a company that owes you nothing and could end up doing basically anything. But a user concerned about how ad-supported web services would infringe on his privacy is trapped in a sort of predictive hell: always right  but always feeling wrong  never quite able to say what will happen  but always expecting it  both constantly vindicated and yet feeling he’s crying wolf. And its users unwittingly took part in a social-data boom and are only now starting to feel the consequences. The ease and speed with which internet users trust tech companies with the data they crave are wildly out of proportion with the risks they’re assuming in doing so  in no small part because  out of negligence or institutional blindness  the companies couldn’t anticipate the risks themselves. After all  Facebook spent years fortifying itself against hackers and spammers only to be rolled by political actors posing as app developers. This pattern — a boom based on credible-seeming promises that are a little too good to be true  followed years later by a bust confirming that they indeed were — is familiar from a different world: finance. The financial crisis was materially devastating in a way that a privacy crisis couldn’t be  poor stewardship of user data isn’t going to evict people from their homes. But among the lingering and underrated consequences of the collapse of the global financial system was a total loss in trust in the institutions that were supposed to prevent it. The disorienting and thoroughly unsatisfying Cambridge Analytica saga is a preview of what trailing indicators of the collapse of the data boom might look like: revealing signs  evident years later  that something was rotten with these arrangements  arriving too late to be actionable but soon enough to foster resentment against companies and services on which we’ve come to depend. Experiences that test our trust of the free-services-for-personal-data internet are accumulating and threaten to become more personal: the failure of Twitter to ban someone who harassed or threatened you  a small but embarrassing email hack resulting in a scammer asking old friends for money and concluding with an admonishment from your provider that you just needed a better password  an identity theft  a suffering credit score and then news of a hack at Equifax  a service to which you never even chose to provide data. Or it could be nothing more than an eerily well-targeted ad  one that suggests that a certain service — maybe one you never even meant to interact with — knows things about you that you don’t remember telling it. The wider consequences of these arrangements are harder to quantify and sometimes even to see. They are: a social-media ecosystem that has annexed the news and the public sphere  nascent but increasingly assertive systems of identity and social currency that seek to transcend borders while answering only to investors  billions of lives’ worth of trustingly volunteered data in the hands of companies that might want to make money from it  or that might have no need for it anymore  or that might go out of business  change ownership or simply forget what they had in the first place. Perhaps someone — a new partner  an enterprising researcher  a repressive government — might  one day  discover new uses for the data. A loss of faith in tech companies as semipublic infrastructure would also arrive simultaneously with an understanding that that’s what they had been all along: services that we depended on  ones we gave ourselves to  and that revealed themselves to be — or merely became — the sorts of services we’d rather not. They’re not too big to fail in the banking sense. But they’re similarly hard to budge  having constructed entire modes of interaction  consumption and identity verification that are now intimately interwoven with our lives  so all-encompassing that they’ve practically become invisible. To stop using these products is to leave the internet  and these companies made it their mission to make sure there isn’t anywhere else to go. In a recent conference call with reporters  Mark Zuckerberg  the company’s chief executive  confessed that Facebook ought to do a better job of putting privacy tools in front of users  but in the same breath he encouraged people to use the tools and to “make sure that they’re comfortable with how their information is used on our services and others.” It was a gesture at dusty old user agreements — an emphasis on the fact that we technically consented to this  and that if he was expected to hold up his end of the deal  we should be too. It called to mind a line of the financial industry’s post-crisis defense: Borrowers should have read the fine print. But for the tech industry  this posture is even more of a stretch: It’s an argument for honoring the status quo  coming from the people who have made it their mission to destroy it.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/09/technology/personaltech/washington-technology.html,In Washington  a Brighter Spotlight on Technology Advertisement Supported by Tech We’re Using None How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Cecilia Kang  a technology reporter based in Washington  discussed the tech she’s using. What are your most important tools for covering technology policy?  Tech has become a big focus in Washington these days  which means I’m spending much of my time on the go  hopping around various agencies and congressional offices to cover news and to meet with sources. None None When I’m covering members of Congress or meeting with government officials  I like to record the conversations and rely on the Voice Memos app. The federal government is infamously bureaucratic about the technology its employees use. What kinds of restrictions do you run into when covering federal agencies  and how do you overcome those hurdles? Last year  after filing a Freedom of Information Act request  I got a big document dump from the Department of Transportation — on a CD-ROM. Our New York Times I.T. staff in Washington had to search for a PC that had a CD drive! None Wi-Fi is the other big challenge. Ironically  the Wi-Fi at the Federal Communications Commission  the agency that regulates the airwaves  was totally unreliable until a few years ago. The agency’s live stream for monthly meetings still often fails. How is tech etiquette different in Washington than elsewhere? I feel like everyone is hunched over their phones in Washington  even more than other places. This is a news-obsessed town that is texting and emailing at all hours. There seems to be a bit of a generational divide on use of communications apps. Younger staffers on Capitol Hill often use encrypted apps and direct messages on Twitter. But even some of my older sources (my peers  really) can sometimes text me at all hours. It feels totally appropriate to call  text  or Signal late at night or during weekends. Many an interview is done with children heard in the background at a park. Outside of work  what tech product do you and your family currently love using? My family is trying hard to not obsess about tech. We spend way too much time on our own screens. But we did get an Amazon Echo speaker and so far  I’m actually underwhelmed. I thought it would rock my world but it’s just marginally more convenient and helpful. Are you actively trying to get your kids to reduce their tech usage? I just wish it was easier for my kids to unplug. YouTube  texting  and Facebook are just so compelling. I have rules and parental controls on their apps but the lure is strong. What are the biggest tech policy stories that readers should pay attention to in the coming years?  None None None None None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,technology
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/arts/art-leaders-network-berlin-vr-virtual-reality.html,Virtual Reality Asserts Itself as an Art Form in Its Own Right Advertisement Supported by None BERLIN — As virtual reality breaks into the art world at all levels  a host of questions about curation  conservation and commercial value is still being explored. The Berlin-based artist Olafur Eliasson said that we were only in “the Stone Age” or prehistoric period for the medium. “There is a new space out there where a lot more people will have access to artistic experience ” he said last week in a panel discussion here at the Art Leaders Network hosted by The New York Times. He added that “the quality of the glasses is getting so much intensely better” over the three years he has been experimenting with virtual reality. None None “You can put your hand in the rain and swish the drops around ” he said. “It has been a challenge to give it an ephemeral quality  but I am very excited about the result.” In April  Acute Art’s VR Museum introduced a subscription program to experience works by Mr. Eliasson and the performance artist Marina Abramovic while distributing the output of five other artists free of charge for nonsubscribers. The website works with three brands of virtual-reality headsets. None None While a painting is acquired through a single sale payment  Mr. Klaris said  virtual-reality works may demand a monetization plan more along the lines of the film industry. An artist who creates such a work “might be paid every time it is sold or distributed ” he said. Khora Contemporary was founded  however  with the main objective of helping established and young artists translate their work into the realm of virtual reality. The company was inaugurated at last year’s Venice Biennale with commissioned works by Paul McCarthy and Christian Lemmerz. Ms. Nedvetskaia cited a “triangular” business model involving the artist  production company and gallery. The structure varies on a “case-by-case basis.” Khora Contemporary is also in talks with film festivals on both sides of the Atlantic. Down the line  Ms. Nedvetskaia envisions creating pay-per-view versions of artwork online. She pointed to virtual reality as a new frontier for artists at a time when all other forms and genres have been explored. “There is little today which is brand new ” she said. But the collector base is just developing. “It is too early to talk about at this point ” she said of “a very nascent market” while mentioning sales in Asia and the interest of private museums and collections. The Salon Berlin of the Museum Frieder Burda — a private collection in Baden-Baden  Germany — is displaying its first virtual-reality component with “The Bridge ” by the Ukranian artist Nikita Shalenny. None The salon’s curator  Patricia Kamp  pointed to the irony that  in an exhibition exploring the alienation from nature in modern society  virtual reality represents a crucial means of harnessing younger visitors. “When art doesn’t move people emotionally  it has no purpose ” she said. “The next generation only grows up with screens. They have a totally different point of access.” “The Bridge” is juxtaposed with both modern and contemporary paintings in an effort to create dialogue between the different mediums. Ms. Nedvetskaia also mentioned the possibility of exhibiting virtual-reality works alongside the physical material on which they were based  such as Shalenny’s watercolors or video directed by Mr. McCarthy. “It makes it more believable ” she said in an interview. “It gives people the confidence that it can be taken seriously as a real art form.” As Glenn D. Lowry  director of the Museum of Modern Art in New York  said during the Art Leaders Network panel “The Future of Art Museums ” contemporary art had transcended formal labels. “There use to be these categories ” he said. “High art  fashion  commerce  you name it. Artists have demolished that.” None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,technology
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/business/car-show-marketing-tech.html,Virtual Reality Is Carmakers’ Latest Selling Tool  at Shows and in Showrooms Advertisement Supported by Wheels None Advances in microprocessor and electronic-sensor technology have helped turn today’s car into an immersive multimedia experience spread across high-definition screens. But car companies do not limit the technological flash to the inside of the car — high-tech  gaming-inspired marketing pitches are following right on its bumper. Automakers are offering augmented reality experiences  video displays that involve the viewer and lifelike virtual reality simulations to lure buyers. The most sophisticated executions are developed primarily for events like the New York International Auto Show  opening to the public on Friday. At shows filled with outrageous concept cars and shiny models making their debuts  it takes more than a pretty car to stand out. Visitors might learn about an automaker’s plans for urban mobility while flying above a make-believe landscape  take a virtual reality sprint around a test track or scream down a drag strip at the wheel of a production-model hot rod. The Dodge Drag Strip Simulator lies at the point where make-believe meets reality  and where automotive engineering spills over into video game science. The latest version roared to life last year in New York and will appear again at this year’s show. The simulation matches two genuine Dodge Demons — with a multitude of electronic and hydraulic devices packed under their hoods where the engines used to be — in a side-by-side contest on a video drag strip that is seen through the vehicles’ windshields. Lifting their front wheels on takeoff  the cars leave the virtual starting line with the slam-you-in-the-seat G-forces of the acceleration wrought by the Demon’s 808 horsepower. Electronically controlled  hydraulically powered struts simulate dynamic events — including the wheelie. Engine vibration and track surface changes are transmitted to the seat of the driver’s pants and synced with the video. Realistic feedback is communicated through the steering wheel  and eardrum-assaulting sound plays through speakers inside and outside the cars. The driver must use the throttle with precision  steer accurately and shift at the correct intervals to record a good elapsed time and top speed. The simulator’s ability to mimic the real thing is uncanny: Dodge reports a best quarter-mile simulator performance of 9.68 seconds at a top speed of 136 m.p.h.  a production Demon took 9.65 seconds and reached 140 m.p.h. when tested by the National Hot Rod Association  the organization that oversees professional drag racing. “We used the automobile’s technology to create a marketing campaign  a campaign that creates a halo for the brand ” said Mark Malmstead  head of marketing for Dodge SRT  the brand’s high-performance arm. “The computers that control the simulation are right out of the Demon.” While simulations put showgoers in the driver’s seat of a device that acts and feels like a real vehicle  virtual reality executions can pack a three-dimensional  360-degree video environment — such as the interior of an automobile and the view through the windows — into a headset. The experience is often enhanced by electronic manipulation of the viewer’s seat. A number of automakers showed off such V.R. systems at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit in January  and the technology is already being used in dealerships. Ford has developed a V.R. display called City of Tomorrow. The experience includes a ride in a flying machine that rises above a make-believe urban landscape and shows off some of the company’s transportation technology. Dynamic control of the seat simulates acceleration and turning forces. It proved popular at the Detroit show and will be part of Ford’s display in New York. After success with a V.R. experience developed for a Connecticut dealer’s showroom  Cadillac is expanding the effort to include more dealerships. Like Cadillac  Lexus has developed a V.R. experience for dealerships and venues other than auto shows. It takes viewers to a virtual space where they can walk around vehicles  open the door to look inside and configure a car of their own  even before it’s available for purchase. “Lexus and Team One took the Virtual Showroom on the road to support dealer launches  create interest at events and inspire preorders ” said Todd Lewis  events marketing strategist for the brand. But in today’s fast-moving digital world  last year’s V.R. technology is just so  well  last year. So some automakers are developing displays that mix real and virtual objects in the same space. Honda used such a system to pit its Civic Type R against a video game version of the same car. The competition  which took place on the Road Atlanta racecourse  is documented in a YouTube video. A racecar driver handled the real car  while an experienced video gamer drove its virtual twin. While the result is interesting — the cars finish within a second of each other — reducing it to flat screen video takes away some of the magic. At the Detroit show  Honda offered a different mixed reality experience that employed Microsoft’s HoloLens technology. Wearing a headset  show attendees were able to walk around and enter a car  with holographic visuals promoting the product all along the way. Carmakers are also using interactive video in their pitches. Many dealerships that sell Mercedes-Benz’s high-performance AMG models are using a system called Power Wall to demonstrate the technology of those six-figure vehicles. AMG vehicles and their components are displayed on video screens as large as 220 inches  and with a touch-screen controller  users can view internal parts  move in to study one  and select videos or demonstrations that provide detailed information. Fiat Chrysler has created a more modestly sized tool that it uses to market upfits — modifications that prep the vehicle for a certain job  such as towing — for its Ram trucks. By holding an iPad up to key spots on a Ram  consumers can visualize a variety of upfit options. But the most impressive way that companies have deployed fresh technology remains those hard-to-replicate experiences  like the Dodge Demon drag simulator or Chevrolet’s virtual reality experience  which puts users on a digital version of the General Motors test track in Milford  Mich.  and at the automaker’s desert proving ground in Yuma  Ariz. Chevrolet calls the display Four Dimensional V.R. because it involves not only the 360-degree view in the headset but also dynamic movement  vibration and even a bit of wind in the face. Electronically controlled seats toss users this way and that as a they ride around the track and up and down hills in various Chevrolets. The display premiered in Detroit and was part of the brand’s Chicago Auto Show display last month  said Paul Edwards  Chevrolet vice president for marketing. More than 20 000 people sampled it at those two shows. It will also be featured in New York. “We wanted to take consumers behind the scenes and demonstrate what we do to ensure the quality of the vehicles ” Mr. Edwards said. “The technological level of the experience has a rub-off on the brand.” None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,technology
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/12/arts/european-museums-get-adventurous-with-virtual-reality.html,European Museums Get Adventurous With Virtual Reality Advertisement Supported by None PARIS — At the National Museum of Natural History in Paris  visitors can take a trip to an ice blue celestial plane surrounded by an aurora borealis. There  a branching orb traces 460 species  including humans  back to the last universal common ancestor  or LUCA  a small single-celled organism thought to be the common origin of all current life on earth. None Bruno David  president of the museum  said it was impossible to illustrate the same concept if restrained to the traditional means of physical objects and text  so the museum turned to technology. The museum renovated a room to permanently house five VR stations and plans to offer a VR sea diving experience to coincide with a 2019 exhibition. Virtual reality  he said  could help make the taxidermy gallery — home to Louis XV’s pet rhinoceros — a little less stuffy. “My aim was to introduce technology of the 21st century into the world of a museum which is generally not regarded as such ” Mr. David said. France’s National Museum of Natural History is just one of many cultural and art institutions using the technology as a new way to engage visitors. While this museum has gone all in  others have been experimenting with VR before committing portions of their budgets. In 2015  the British Museum was one of the first institutions to offer a virtual reality experience through a weekend event dedicated to Bronze Age objects and showing them in their original context. Hannah Boulton  head of press and marketing at the museum  says it has been a testing process over the past few years to find where VR can have the most impact for the institution. “For us  it’s about audience engagement ” she said. “We don’t want to be doing it for VR’s sake. What we want to do is use VR where it can lend that extra context.” None None Since there is no photographic record of the artist’s final home  Tate undertook painstaking research to recreate it as a virtual reality space. A team took forensic-level photographs of the present-day studio  now private property  and designed furniture based on photos from the artist’s move  analyzed paint materials and took details from visitors’ diaries and letters. “VR has value for us as an interpretation tool ” said Hilary Knight  head of digital content at Tate. “It’s a way of conveying feeling  helping people feel a connection with an artist. It’s a different way of absorbing that information  and it makes the artist a living person.” While VR might be an obvious attraction for younger  tech-hungry audiences  institutions are finding older visitors are also eager to explore digital worlds. None Hanna Forssell  head curator of education  expected it to appeal mostly to the under-18 set that makes up one-third of the museum’s entries. Instead  she was surprised by the interest from all ages. When the feature started recently  she said  “There was a long line of mainly older people over 60.” Ms. Knight said she would like to use VR more in future exhibitions  but despite the success of the Modigliani experience  she is still uncertain about sustainability. Ms. Boulton also said the British Museum’s VR projects are “heavily funded” by technology partners. “It’s hard to create a strategy at the moment because we don’t yet know where funding for these kinds of projects will come from ” Ms. Knight said. “Visitors ask about future exhibitions  so there is an appetite.” None Victoria Chang  director of VIVE Arts  said the program was born in response to an increase in the number of requests that HTC began receiving about two years ago and that continues to grow. “It was important for us to be able to foster this phenomenon in a more systematic way ” Ms. Chang said. She says VR will soon be just as important to a museum as its website. “When the internet was just developing  institutions didn’t see the need to have an online presence ” Ms. Chang said. “Now with social media and cellphones  all the major institutions have apps.” None The VR experiences from Tate and the French National Museum of Natural History are available online to the public. As for critics who worry that might keep some people at home and out of museums  institutions agree virtual will never replace reality but can enhance it. “People are coming to a museum to see real objects because real objects are emotional ” Mr. David said. “If you’re going to L’Orangerie  it’s to see Monet’s original ‘Water Lilies ’ not to see a copy. Otherwise  on your computer you can see much better images than the real thing.” None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,technology
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/10/arts/virtual-reality-art.html,Virtual Reality Lets Rare Works of Art Take a Field Trip Advertisement Supported by None AMSTERDAM — This museum is floating in outer space. In front of you  there is a line of stunning European old master paintings to observe and explore. Behind you is a sleek walkway over the infinite void of sky and stars. If you were to take a running leap  you’d fly out into nothingness and never stop. Except that you’d probably hit the wall of a conference room first. None In recent years  many museums have made their artworks digitally accessible by uploading high-resolution images to the internet as “virtual museums.” Meanwhile  contemporary “virtual-reality artists” have been using high-tech stereoscopic tools such as Google Tilt Brush  HTC Vive and Oculus Rift to paint or sculpt in three dimensions. The Dutch art collectors George and Ilone Kremer decided to combine these two developments: They’ve reproduced 74 artworks from their own stellar art collection  to create a traditional museum experience using video-game technologies and a 21st-century twist. None “We’ve been trying to spread knowledge about our collection as wide as possible over many years  and this is a much faster way of reaching many more people ” Mr. Kremer said in an interview. “With a mobile app that works  you have the world as your marketplace.” Although the couple has been sharing their art collection for decades through exhibitions  museum loans and other means  this is the first time they don’t have to worry about travel wear and tear. “That’s the beauty of this type of museum ” Mr. Kremer said. “You never have to think about security  insurance or transport fees or any of that. No plumbing or building codes.” The Kremers  who live in Dubai and have homes in Dallas and Amsterdam  have been collecting art since 1994  when Mr. Kremer bought a drawing by Govert Flinck  one of Rembrandt’s most successful pupils  from the Amsterdam gallery Salomon Lilian. None The idea for a virtual-reality museum came from their son Joël  who had worked in the United States for Google. Joël eventually became the director of the museum and spearheaded the project. Each painting in the collection was photographed about 3 000 times and then merged into a 3-D image using photogrammetry  or measurements of surface points. Visitors to the museum can therefore look not only at the front of a picture  but also walk around and see labels and other markings on the back. Glitches still need to be worked out. The image resolution still appears to be inadequate to create a sufficiently high-resolution reproduction. And the subject matter doesn’t help: 17th-century Dutch painting  especially the domestic genre scenes favored by the Kremers  was very detail-oriented  beauty can be found in the flicker of light on a woman’s silk gown  or light glancing off a pearl  or the exquisitely meticulous fringe on a tablecloth. Joël Kremer acknowledged that the pixelation isn’t adequate right now  but said the issue was being worked on and that it seemed likely that this would be fixed as the technology inevitably improved. The Kremers have made what they will only describe as “a significant investment” of money to develop the museum. George Kremer is quick to note  however  that  “Building this is a fraction of what a physical building would cost.” To achieve the same ethereal setting  he added  “You’d then have to shoot it into space  and that would be a costly affair.” None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,technology
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/style/virtual-reality-porn.html,Virtual Reality Gets Naughty Advertisement Supported by None In early 2014 Ela Darling  31  a pornographic actress  recorded her first virtual reality sex scene. She was in a college dorm room at the University of Maryland dressed in an R2-D2 swimsuit and high athletic socks. She sat on a twin bed  next to a wooden desk  and spoke to the camera as if it were a real person. There was no story line and no other actors. “It was a solo masturbation scene ” she said. “I was coy and flirty and then a little bit dirty. I felt sexy as hell.” Ms. Darling had been filming pornography since she was 22 and took her job seriously. It was her responsibility to convince audiences to connect with her physically and emotionally. She tried everything  including acting out bondage fetishes  performing erotic electrostimulation (“electrosex”) on another woman and dressing as a real-estate agent. Yet no matter what she did to entice and engage  the results had always been voyeuristic  since there was always a screen separating her and her fans. This time  though  was different. Virtual reality uses many camera lenses to record the same scene from hundreds of angles. When the takes are stitched together  the viewer gets a 180- or 240-degree view of the room and the feeling that he or she is there  participating. As soon as Ms. Darling viewed the scene she recorded  she knew virtual reality would be a sea change to her job and the adult-entertainment industry. “You can pretend like you are in the bedroom with me  and it is someone you have a crush on ” she said. “You are in the experience.” While virtual-reality pornography may feel like something out of a science fiction movie  it already has a formidable  if underground  presence. According to website Pornhub  views of VR porn are up 275 percent since it debuted in the summer of 2016. Now the site is averaging about 500 000 views (on Christmas Day in 2016  this number shot up to 900 000.) None “We’re getting more and more of it every day ” said Mark Kernes  a senior editor at AVN Media Network  which covers the industry. “We are leading the technology in this area. Sex sells  and where there is money to be made  there will be entrepreneurs who want to adopt it and make money from it ” some by offering it for free to increase clicks. Pornography is what rushed along the first printing press  and spurred developments in the internet  online payment systems and other technology. Now it’s time for virtual reality  Mr. Kernes said: “I’m pretty sure there is more porn VR out there than regular VR.” Ms. Darling first experienced regular old VR at E3  a conference for the video-game industry. Excited by the pornography possibilities  she found a college student on Reddit who knew the technology but lacked a star. Before long  Ms. Darling started streaming weekly VR segments live from her bedroom in Los Angeles. None Though the pornography industry as a whole is challenging to regulate  considering the potential for abuse  disease and exploitation  the virtual kind comes with extra moral and maybe legal issues. For example  can you use someone’s likeness to have sex with them in virtual reality? None At this year’s AVN Adult Entertainment Expo  a convention and trade show held each January in Las Vegas  the latest advancements in virtual reality pornography were on display. None There are also companies that are adding taste and touch to the experience. None Still other virtual reality companies were showing off their partnerships with sex toy companies to create vibrators or penis pumps that link to VR material. “As the action ramps up so does the vibrations of the vibrator ” he said. None “How do you feel about sex?” an unknown presenter asks her in one video. “Sex is one of the most fascinating things in the world ” she responds in a raspy voice. “I don’t see anything wrong with it.” Harmony can connect with virtual reality so the user can interact with her in that space  she can perform all the acts the viewer is watching. “It’s a little bit of a video game combined with sci-fi ” said Matt McMullen  the C.E.O. and creative director of Realbotix. The company has been making dolls for 20 years that were linked to artificial intelligence but not virtual reality. “Based on our experiences with thousands of clients ” Mr. McMullen said  “people do use them for sex  but there is something more that exists. We focus on companionship.” None When Ms. Darling does live X-rated performances  users can leave comments and chat to one another on the side of the screen. “The people who are in virtual reality tell the other people watching me in 2-D to stop being jerks and knock it off ” she said. “They feel like they know me and are in the bedroom with me.” None None Ms. Cole  the podcast host  is most excited about how virtual reality can be used in sex education. “What if we had young people watch videos where they practice consent or practice identifying at-risk behaviors?” she said. “Or they can be in a room with someone who said  ‘I contacted herpes and this is my experience.’ That is way more informative than a gonorrhea slide.” Indeed. Barbara Rothbaum  a professor in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Emory University School of Medicine and the director of Emory’s Veterans Program  is studying how virtual reality can help treat people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder caused by military sexual trauma. The program is building scenes that take victims to barracks  tents  private living quarters  latrines  offices or remote buildings and vehicles  where the trauma may have taken place. The idea is that going back to these places virtually will help victims confront their memories so they can move forward with more internal peace. But for virtual reality to work  the scenes have to be so lifelike that users get lost in them and take them for reality. They have to feel like they are participants  not just observers. “We can create 3-D bodies in virtual reality and do whatever we want with them ” Ms. Cole said. As the technology becomes good enough to make that happen  issues are bound to arise. Mr. McMullen said an issue his company has is clients commissioning dolls that look exactly like people they know in real life  maybe an ex-girlfriend they never got over or someone about whom they fantasize. His company requires written consent from the model for his or her likeness to be used. Ms. Cole said VR companies are going to have to address this same problem as they get better at customizing avatars to look exactly like what their customers desire. “What are the lines between reality and fantasy and what can we do in this space?” she said. “What does consent mean in virtual reality? Can you do something to your girlfriend in virtual reality that you wouldn’t do in real life? If you are using someone’s likeness in virtual reality  do you require their permission? And what about revenge porn? That will be even harsher in virtual reality.” She is worried about the technology assimilating into the culture as easily as dating apps  drawing people away from flesh-and-blood encounters. Certainly partners will also have to negotiate whether virtual-reality sex constitutes cheating. It is  after all  much more lifelike than traditional pornography. But Mr. McMullen said a lot of people accuse his sex robot of doing that  but he believes he is helping alleviate a bad situation  not causing it. “There are people who are already lonely  and people who live their lives being alone. They work all day and come home to an empty house ” he said. “This is just offering an alternative to those types of people. They don’t have anyone else.” None None None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,technology

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/24/sports/virtual-reality-athletes.html,Virtual Reality Companies Are Changing How Athletes See Practice Advertisement Supported by None Stanford kicker Jet Toner drags his right foot on the ground  then taps it twice. He looks down at the football in front of him and visualizes a line extending to the white poles 40 yards ahead. Defensive players shake out their quads and bend into squats in front of him  their hamstrings screaming from the second practice of the day. Sweat darkens their practice jerseys. The holder crouches  pats the grass with two fingers — the “go ahead.” Toner wiggles his right shoulder and turns his right wrist a few times  as he always does before field goal attempts. He tilts forward in anticipation  his eyes locked on the football. He exhales  springs lightly onto his left foot  and then takes two bounding hops before swinging a locked  pointed foot just below the holder’s fingers. He only narrowly avoids nailing his foot into the wall. This is Stanford’s virtual reality training room: a little glass box above the locker room where a virtual reality headset — a foamy black box flanked by three limp elastic headbands — dangles midair  suspended by a thick black cord. A desktop computer displays VR footage simulations used by almost every player position. Toner picks a simulation  clicks “Play” and slides goggles down his face. Instantly  high definition pixels surge out of the black vacuum. His flip-flops melt into cleats  his brain believes he is back at practice. He can pivot 180 degrees and watch Coach David Shaw making clipboard tallies  or look straight ahead and count a lineman’s eyelashes. This training VR is not animated — it’s real video. “I was pretty blown away by how immersive it was ” Toner says. “I was hesitant it would be helpful. After using it I was like  ‘Wow  this is a whole different angle that you just don’t get when you’re watching a typical film with your coach.’” Since 2015  sports virtual reality has expanded beyond college football to become the sparkly new training toy for professional programs in the N.F.L.  N.H.L.  N.B.A.  M.L.B. and Japanese baseball leagues. The industry pioneers — EON Sports VR and STRIVR — both grew out of college football. Shaw was one of the first coaches to adopt STRIVR in 2015 and is now an investor. Toner kicks field goals on real-life fields while an unwieldy contraption — what appears to be six GoPros welded together into a 360 degree video camera — records by his shoulder. Then  Toner can relive kicks using a VR headset. None As the N.C.A.A. and N.F.L. increasingly restrict the frequency of so-called hitting practices  virtual reality training is providing a contact-free way to keep players sharp. “It’s one of the reasons STRIVR was so successful to begin with  especially in college teams ” says Shawnee Baughman  the company’s product manager. “I think the N.C.A.A. coaches are really excited to be able to use a tool that allows their players more practice without breaking practice regulation rules  fatiguing them or injuring them.” For all the industry enthusiasm  VR’s record is rife with letdowns. Since the ’90s  almost every round of virtual reality hype has disappointed. Unresolved issues of motion sickness  fuzzy graphics and clunky equipment sabotaged almost any sense of “reality.” It simply wasn’t cool enough for its price. Today  VR once again demands the tech world’s attention  thanks to investments from Facebook  HTC  Valve and Samsung. Yet while VR costs are decreasing  it’s still not easy on budgets. Adopting STRIVR costs between $50 000 and $150 000  EON Sports’ products start at $5 000 and hit an undisclosed “much more than that” on the high end  according to chief executive Brendan Reilly. For pro sports programs  VR must prove more useful than a handful of interns or new weight room equipment. For quarterbacks  VR is a decision-making incubator — a playbook with moving X’s and O’s. Before quarterbacks press play  their teammates are frozen  as if they’re in a personalized wax figure museum. A button clicks  and they bubble to life  jogging to predetermined positions. Quarterbacks train to spot defensive gaps and open receivers. Linemen train to spot blitzes  and safeties look for offensive tells. In bird’s-eye game film  plays are simplified  and correct decisions appear obvious. In VR  each snap is a kaleidoscopic human puzzle  with every piece constantly shifting positions  glaring  deceiving. “You can only get so much out of a traditional sideline anymore ” says Chas Petrone  Vanderbilt’s director of football video services  who also manages Vanderbilt’s sports VR. “You go down  you put the headset on and you’re almost going up against the defense again. It’s decreasing your reaction time and making you that much better on the field.” The brain’s reflex center believes VR experience is real. “It’s visualization times a million ” says Conrad Ukropina  Toner’s predecessor at Stanford. “Kicking is like golf. It’s like bowling. You want everything to be unconscious and muscle memory. The magic is the extra edge you can get.” None “If we make it we win. If I miss it we lose ” Ukropina recalls thinking. “It was as big as a kick can get.” None “It felt comfortable and looked familiar ” Ukropina says. “I didn’t think about it in the moment  but afterward I was like  ‘Oh my gosh  it was literally identical.’ It started conscious and moved into unconscious because I’ve done it so many times.” None But the potential for VR performance training extends beyond athletics to more mundane activities. In one simulation  it’s 5 a.m. in a Walmart vegetable aisle. An older woman — an actress — peruses the green peppers. First-time users wander around the store aimlessly  their eyes darting from frail  translucent produce bags to plastic carts brimming with butternut squash. They don’t know what they’re supposed to be looking for. “The problem is in the bottom row ” Baughman  STRIVR’s product manager  explains  her voice floating into the vacuum like a movie narrator’s. The carrots and the celery are stacked too high  and no cold air can get to the bottom vegetables. Customers won’t want moldy carrots. If Walmart employees are to pass this test  they must catch the mistake. In 10 years  virtual reality training could be everywhere — from kindergarten classrooms to NASA training centers. For some  it’s underwhelming  the black-rimmed fantasy gear of childhood dreams has finally materialized  only to shave seconds off player reaction-times at a cost of thousands of dollars. Derek Belch  the chief executive of STRIVR  and Reilly recognize the need to find uses appealing to average people — the ones who could never hit a field goal in virtual reality  much less daily life. “Eight months ago  no one would have been asking whether this was a fad  because there was so much coolness about it ” Reilly says. “Then there was this ‘Oh wait  once the hype wears off  why are we doing this? How can we measure real value?’” None None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,technology
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/29/business/virtual-reality-driverless-cars.html,What Virtual Reality Can Teach a Driverless Car Advertisement Supported by None SAN FRANCISCO — As the computers that operate driverless cars digest the rules of the road  some engineers think it might be nice if they can learn from mistakes made in virtual reality rather than on real streets. Companies like Toyota  Uber and Waymo have discussed at length how they are testing autonomous vehicles on the streets of Mountain View  Calif.  Phoenix and other cities. What is not as well known is that they are also testing vehicles inside computer simulations of these same cities. Virtual cars  equipped with the same software as the real thing  spend thousands of hours driving their digital worlds. Think of it as a way of identifying flaws in the way the cars operate without endangering real people. If a car makes a mistake on a simulated drive  engineers can tweak its software accordingly  laying down new rules of behavior. On Monday  Waymo  the autonomous car company that spun out of Google  is expected to show off its simulator tests when it takes a group of reporters to its secretive testing center in California’s Central Valley. Researchers are also developing methods that would allow cars to actually learn new behavior from these simulations  gathering skills more quickly than human engineers could ever lay them down with explicit software code. “Simulation is a tremendous thing ” said Gill Pratt  chief executive of the Toyota Research Institute  one of the artificial intelligence labs exploring this kind of virtual training for autonomous vehicles and other robotics. None “This is why we think we can move fast ” said Luc Vincent  who recently started an autonomous vehicle project at Lyft  Uber’s main rival. “This stuff didn’t exist 10 years ago when Google started.” None None For now  if it doesn’t carry a backup driver  any autonomous vehicle will probably be limited to a small area with large streets  little precipitation  and relatively few pedestrians. And it will drive at low speeds  often waiting for extended periods before making a left-hand turn or merging into traffic without the help of a stoplight or street sign — if it doesn’t avoid these situations altogether. None None The trouble is that this requires enormous amounts of data collected by cameras  radar and other sensors that document real-world objects and situations. And humans must label this data  identifying pedestrians  street signs and the like. Gathering and labeling data describing every conceivable situation is an impossibility. Data on accidents  for instance  is hard to come by. This is where simulations can help. None Mr. Pratt said Toyota is already using images of simulated roadways to train neural networks  and this approach has yielded promising results. In other words  the simulations are similar enough to the physical world to reliably train the systems that operate the cars. Part of the advantage with a simulator is that researchers have complete control over it. They need not spend time and money labeling images — and potentially making mistakes with these labels. “You have ground truth ” Mr. Pratt explained. “You know where every car is. You know where every pedestrian is. You know where every bicycler is. You know the weather.” None DeepMind used this method to build a machine that could play the ancient game Go better than any human. In essence  the machine played thousands upon thousands of Go games against itself  carefully recording which moves proved successful and which didn’t. And now  DeepMind and other leading labs are using similar techniques in building machines that can play complex video games like StarCraft. That may seem frivolous. But if machines can navigate these virtual worlds  they can make their way through the physical world. None Bridging the gap between the virtual and the physical is no easy task  Mr. Pratt said. And companies must also ensure that algorithms don’t learn unexpected or harmful behavior while learning on their own. That is a big worry among artificial intelligence researchers. For this and other reasons  companies like Toyota and Waymo are not building these cars solely around machine learning. They also hand-coded software in more traditional ways in an effort to guarantee certain behavior. Waymo cars don’t learn to stop at stop lights  for example. There is a hard and fast rule that they stop. But the industry is headed toward more machine learning  not less. It provides a better way to train the car to do tasks like identifying lane makers  said Waymo’s vice president of engineering Dmitri Dolgov. But it becomes even more important  he explained  when a car needs a much deeper understanding of the world around it. “Robotics and machine learning go hand in hand ” he said.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/technology/personaltech/virtual-reality-video.html,Pioneering Virtual Reality and New Video Technologies in Journalism Advertisement Supported by Tech We’re Using None How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Marcelle Hopkins  deputy video editor and co-director of virtual reality at The Times  discussed the tech she is using. Video has changed a lot in recent years. How have you and the video department incorporated new video technologies  and what technologies has the department helped pioneer for journalism? None None How do you pilot test new technologies for video? How do you determine if something makes the cut for broader use in the newsroom? Sometimes we practice with new cameras around the office or at home before using them on a story. Other times we send them out on a reporting trip for a trial by fire. None What have been the strengths of using virtual reality for journalism? What unexpected stumbling blocks have you come across with it? None Unexpected stumbling blocks arise frequently because we’re working on the edges of what we know how to do. There’s often a gap between how we want to tell a story and the tools that we have to do it. That’s when we hack available hardware or software to suit our needs. None I don’t know who will make it  but the first immersive media wearable to be widely adopted will look and function more like a pair of reading glasses than like the V.R. headsets we have today. The first generation of modern V.R. and augmented reality headsets are too clunky to go mainstream. They’re heavy and awkward  sometimes connected to a computer by a cable. They’re good prototypes for getting us started in immersive platforms  but I hope someone builds something that’s more convenient for everyday use. I’m ready for a pair of glasses that uses light field technology to integrate interactive digital information in the real world around me. I want Google Maps to draw directions on the street in front of me. I want Netflix to project a movie on my living room wall. I want AccuWeather to show me today’s highs and lows on my coat closet door. I want NYT Cooking to put recipe demos on my countertop. When that’s possible  I think  glasses will eventually replace smartphones. How are you thinking about augmented reality and its application toward journalism? A.R. has huge potential for journalism. There are already a few applications that we’ve seen that could be useful in our reporting. None Location-based A.R. has widespread applications for news  travel  culture and real estate. When visiting the vineyards of Sonoma County  you could access tips and highlights from our Travel section. None Of course  I’m most excited about the A.R. applications we haven’t thought of yet. Outside of work  what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life and why? I often joke that Spotify knows me better than anyone in my life. My favorite feature is Spotify’s Discover Weekly  which serves me a personalized playlist of music I’ve never heard. I save the songs I like  and occasionally make my own playlists out of the ones I love. As with any machine learning algorithm  the more you use it  the smarter it gets. At this point  Spotify is really good (probably better than me) at something I don’t have time for anymore — finding new music I like. How much do you take video personally for friends and family and for social media? Or do you leave all of that at work? I’ve gone through phases with documenting my personal life. Right now I’m in a social media lull and don’t take many photos or videos outside of work. It’s a real treat for me to abandon my phone when I’m spending time with friends and family.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/business/media/amc-theaters-virtual-reality.html,Coming Soon to AMC Theaters: Virtual Reality Experiences Advertisement Supported by None CULVER CITY  Calif. — It is easily Hollywood’s hottest start-up. Steven Spielberg was an early investor. So were 21st Century Fox  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Warner Bros. The venture’s leadership team includes the former chief of Disney’s theme park design division  the producer of the “Men in Black” movie series  and a live event kingpin. And now AMC Entertainment  the world’s largest theater chain  has invested $20 million in the fledgling company and agreed to finance the rapid rollout of its product in the United States and Britain. None “We were mesmerized by what we saw ” said Adam Aron  chief executive of AMC Entertainment. “Their vision is to change what V.R. has been — away from just a heightened level of video game and toward cinematic storytelling — and we think it’s what consumers have been waiting for.” None “In many cases  we have surplus space  and we think Dreamscape will add energy and excitement to our theaters  especially during the week ” Mr. Aron said. “But this isn’t a replacement for movies. It’s a complement.” Tickets are expected to cost from $15 to $20. None None The Hollywood players behind Dreamscape give it immediate cachet. Joining Mr. Spielberg are people like Hans Zimmer  the movie music composer  and the director Gore Verbinski. But their involvement does not guarantee success. Mr. Spielberg  for one  has been down this road before  with mixed results. In the late 1990s  his DreamWorks SKG invested alongside Universal Pictures in a heavily promoted venture called GameWorks  which was supposed to use new technology to revolutionize the arcade business. GameWorks never lived up to its billing. None Two members of the Dreamscape management team  Walter Parkes  a co-chairman  and Bruce Vaughn  the chief executive  are very familiar with those efforts. Mr. Parkes  a movie producer whose credits include the “Men in Black” series  worked for Mr. Spielberg as a senior DreamWorks executive at the time. Mr. Vaughn spent 23 years at Disney  most recently serving as chief creative officer of its Imagineering research and design unit. “Even big-name brands can have a hard time getting people to go here instead of there ” Mr. Vaughn acknowledged. None “This is truly the birth of a new storytelling medium ” Mr. Parkes said. As if to prove it  Mr. Parkes took a reporter through a prototype Dreamscape experience. The company uses more than a dozen cameras and sensors to transport people into various settings — home plate in a sold-out baseball stadium  the spider-filled ruins of an ancient temple or a futuristic  neon-lit city flooded with water. You put on V.R. goggles and a pair of gloves. An attendant clips a small device to your shoes. And off you go. Inside Dreamscape experiences  which will last about nine minutes and cost about $1.5 million to $2 million to produce  participants can handle objects and — as avatars — even pass them between one another. “A shared experience is what makes the lasting emotional impact ” said Mr. Vaughn  noting his track record in creating Disney theme park attractions. Dreamscape is developing original content. Mr. Parkes said the company was also negotiating with various studios and filmmakers to create experiences that put people inside movie franchises. “If you enjoy our experience  you’ll be more likely to see the movie  and vice versa ” he said.
