https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/05/business/patagonia-trump-bears-ears.html,Patagonia v. Trump The outdoor retailer has supported grass-roots environmental activists for decades. Now it is suing the president in a bid to protect Bears Ears National Monument. None Supported by None VENTURA  Calif. — The offices of Patagonia occupy a low-slung complex of stucco buildings in this sleepy beachside town in Southern California. There are solar panels and picnic tables in the parking lot  day care with a jungle gym by the main lobby and easy access to the beach  where employees surf during lunch break. It is a corporate Eden of sorts  where idealistic Californians run a privately held company that sells about $1 billion of puffy down jackets and organic cotton jeans each year. But on an unseasonably hot and windy Monday morning in early December  Patagonia headquarters were transformed into something that quickly resembled a war room. There were emergency conference calls with Washington lawyers. Court filings were prepared. Web designers remade the company’s home page. It wasn’t a business crisis that had mobilized the company  however. It was politics. None Mr. Trump said the decision was about reducing federal overreach. “Some people think that the natural resources of Utah should be controlled by a small handful of very distant bureaucrats located in Washington ” he said. “And guess what. They’re wrong.” Yet to the tribal groups and conservationists who had been monitoring the situation  including Patagonia  the decision realized some of their worst fears: that the Trump administration would be waging an assault on public lands  and potentially opening up protected areas to drilling and mining. Patagonia was as ready for this moment as any company could be. For more than 45 years  the company has mixed business and politics to a degree unusual in corporate America. While companies are expected to weigh in on everything from gun control to transgender rights these days — and many do so uncomfortably — Patagonia has been unapologetically political since the 1970s. It bills itself “the Activist Company” and publicly advocates for environmental protection  fair trade and stricter labor standards. It supports thousands of grass-roots environmental activists  and has been involved with Bears Ears since 2012. But until December  Patagonia had never tangled with a president. That Monday morning  about 50 Patagonia employees gathered in a conference room to watch Mr. Trump’s speech. The mood was somber. Then  within an hour of the president’s remarks  Patagonia updated the home page of its website. Instead of promotional images advertising colorful products  there was a stark message against a black background: “The President Stole Your Land.” At the same time  Patagonia’s legal team set into motion a plan that had been in the works for months: It would sue the president. Working with a handful of local groups and the law firm Hogan Lovells  Patagonia filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in Washington. The lawsuit named as defendants Mr. Trump  Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke  the secretary of agriculture  the director of the Bureau of Land Management and the chief of the Forest Service. And the argument was simple: The Antiquities Act of 1906 gave presidents the power to create national monuments. But it did not grant the power to reduce them. “For as much authority as it gave to the president to create these monuments  Congress gave the president no authority to revoke or modify those monuments ” the lawsuit reads. “Congress is the sole authority that can undertake such changes.” None The barbs only stiffened Patagonia’s resolve. The company’s founder went on CNN and called the Trump administration “evil.” And Rose Marcario  Patagonia’s chief executive officer  made the protection of Bears Ears one of her top priorities. “We’ve always given to grass-roots organizations  it’s part of our D.N.A. ” she said in a recent interview at company headquarters  an American flag flying outside her window. “But the fight got a lot more urgent after the election. This was totally unheard-of.” It would have been enough for one day if Patagonia had just been caught up in a public spat with the president. But hours after Mr. Trump’s announcement  a more urgent crisis emerged: A brush fire was reported in Santa Paula  Calif.  a small community not far from Patagonia’s headquarters. The hot  dry Santa Ana winds blowing that day whipped the fire into an inferno  and much of Ventura was soon evacuated. At the very moment Patagonia was preparing to sue the president  its campus was shut down indefinitely and employees fled their homes. “We did a lot of scenario planning for the lawsuit ” said Corley Kenna  Patagonia’s head of communications. “We didn’t put on the list that life-threatening fires would be happening at the same time.” Patagonia was founded by Yvon Chouinard  an enigmatic mountain climber with an interest in Zen Buddhism and a passion for the environment. In 1957  he taught himself to blacksmith  and began making and selling climbing gear that was less damaging to the rocks he and his buddies were scaling in Yosemite National Park. Within a few years  he had set up shop in Ventura and was doing a brisk business selling clothing for outdoor enthusiasts. He eventually called the company Patagonia  a homage to the vast mountainous region at the southern tip of South America  where he had recently traveled. Patagonia developed a cult following and expanded its offerings. But for the most part  the company was a means to an end  a source of funds that enabled Mr. Chouinard and his friends to surf  climb and travel their way around the world. That changed in 1972  when Mr. Chouinard attended a City Council meeting to hear about development plans along the Ventura River. Under a proposal being considered  the flow of the river would have been changed  and a prized surf break could have been ruined. At the meeting  it looked as if the development would proceed. Then a young environmental activist  Mark Capelli  took the floor. He presented a slide show and argued that the proposed changes would harm the birds  water snakes and muskrats in the estuary. The development was halted  the river was protected  and the surf break was preserved. Mr. Chouinard befriended Mr. Capelli and began to support his work  giving free office space to his nascent organization  Friends of the Ventura River  and helping to fend off several more attempts to develop the river. That set the template. Patagonia would offer small grants to local activists  give in-kind support through marketing know-how and business savvy  and amplify their message with customers. Mr. Chouniard also resolved to give one percent of Patagonia’s sales to support environmental activism. None None “Patagonia has established a unique role in the political and policy ecosystem  and are willing to be very public about their advocacy ” said Neil Kornze  who was a director of the Bureau of Land Management under President Barack Obama and now runs an environmental consulting firm. “They are a group of avid environmentalists who just happen to sell coats.” Business is booming under Ms. Marcario. A former private equity executive who walked away from finance to study Buddhist meditation in India for two years  Ms. Marcario joined Patagonia in 2008 as chief financial officer  drawn to the company’s environmental activism. “That’s why I’m not on Wall Street right now making a ton of money ” she said. “I’m kind of worried about the planet.” She was named chief executive in 2014  and has overseen Patagonia’s continued expansion. Revenues and profits have quadrupled over the past 10 years  according to the company. None None And the company maintains a team of 18 people focused on supporting activism and distributing grants. Since 1985  Patagonia has given away some $90 million to environmental causes. “Science without activism is dead science ” Mr. Chouinard said in a recent interview. “We want to fund the little activist organizations that are out there on the front lines  the grandmothers in front of the bulldozers.” In 2012  one of the little activist organizations that Patagonia supported for the first time was Friends of Cedar Mesa  a small nonprofit organization advocating for the protection of a wide swath of sensitive desert in southern Utah  including the area that would become Bears Ears. At the time  Republicans in Utah  notably Representative Rob Bishop  were intensifying efforts to reduce federal protections of some lands in the state. Doing so could open the door for more oil and gas drilling and uranium mining  bringing in additional state tax revenue. None “Patagonia has been interested in this area for a long time ” Mr. Ewing said. “More than any company I’ve ever seen  they put their money where their mouth is.” As Patagonia learned more about Bears Ears  which was a favorite of rock climbers  it came to appreciate the area’s significance. Sacred land to tribal groups and home to Hopi and Navajo ruins and petroglyphs carved into rock walls  it was a largely unspoiled terrain that could be threatened by expanded drilling and mining. “As we got more involved  we recognized the cultural and spiritual importance of the place ” said Lisa Pike Sheehy  Patagonia’s vice president of environmental activism. “This was a place that should have been protected 50 years ago.” In total  Patagonia has spent some $2 million on efforts to protect Bears Ears  including making grants to nonprofit groups  producing films and other marketing materials  and buying television ads. And at least for a brief moment  they worked. None “We never got the chance to celebrate the monument being created ” Mr. Ewing said. “The writing was on the wall. There wasn’t ever a moment when we thought the monument was safe.” Inside Patagonia  Ms. Marcario and her staff knew their resolve would soon be tested. On the morning after Mr. Trump’s election  Ms. Marcario sent out an all-staff email. “Defending our air  soil and water has never been more important ” she wrote. “In the last few years  our voice and reach has grown louder and stronger … we won’t stop.” None During a monthslong public comment period  the Interior Department received more than two million submissions  the majority of them supporting the continued protection of public lands. Patagonia said its customers had submitted more than 150 000 comments. During the first months of the new administration  Ms. Marcario and another Patagonia employee  Hans Cole  made numerous attempts to meet with Mr. Zinke as part of outdoor industry delegations  according to internal Interior Department emails reviewed by The Times. No meeting with Mr. Zinke ever took place  but Mr. Cole joined two meetings with Interior Department staff. Around this time  Patagonia also began planning for its eventual lawsuit. It enlisted Hogan Lovells  which tracked developments on the issue and organized a weekly conference call for the eventual plaintiffs. None None The retailers added an economic argument to the campaign to protect Bears Ears: Outdoor recreation contributes more than $12 billion annually to the Utah economy  spending that could be jeopardized if public lands are developed. None That evening  Ms. Marcario was driving north along the California coast  returning home from a business trip. As she approached Patagonia’s headquarters  she could see flames encircling Ventura. “I saw the whole ridge line on fire ” she said. “I realized we wouldn’t be able to go back to the office.” Patagonia enacted its emergency plan overnight. Employees were instructed to stay away from campus  and the company offered to pay for accommodations for anyone who had to evacuate. A skeleton crew stayed behind at Patagonia  putting out spot fires as they flared up on campus. The fire spread  surrounding Ventura and consuming hospitals and apartment buildings on the outskirts of town. “There was ash falling like rain ” Ms. Marcario said. “It was something I have never seen before.” None Mr. Zinke hit back. “You mean Patagonia made in China?” he said on a press call  accusing the company of playing politics in a gambit to sell more clothes. “I think it’s shameful and appalling that they would blatantly lie in order to gain money in their coffers.” Then on Fox Business Network  Mr. Zinke took issue with Patagonia’s activism. “They should focus on how to bring manufacturing back to this country  rather than lying to the public about losing federal land ” he said. None None As Patagonia and Trump supporters traded barbs  the blaze  known as the Thomas Fire  became the largest wildfire in modern California history. Burning for more than a month  it destroyed more than 1 000 structures and forced the evacuation of some 100 000 people. Downtown Ventura and the Patagonia campus were spared  but five employees lost their homes. With the fire still burning out of control on Dec. 6  Ms. Marcario was working from her home in Montecito  30 minutes north of headquarters. Friends and employees who had fled were staying with her  though Ms. Marcario would later be forced to evacuate  too. “Then in the middle of what felt like the apocalypse  across my inbox comes an email ” she said. “Patagonia versus Donald Trump  et al.” Ms. Marcario placed a call to her executive team and informed it that she had approved the lawsuit. Patagonia was suing the president. Since that week in December  the feud between Patagonia and the Trump administration has continued to simmer. None None None “The decision was nothing more than a political favor ” Ms. Sheehy  the company’s vice president of environmental activism  wrote in a blog post. “The redrawing of boundaries was deliberate  and directly influenced by an industry that spends millions of dollars lobbying the government to get what it wants.” The Trump administration has not formally responded to the lawsuit filed by Patagonia and the other plaintiffs. Heather Swift  a spokeswoman for the Interior Department  said in an email that claims that the redrawing of boundaries was motivated by oil and gas interests were “patently and demonstrably false.” Ms. Marcario draws a link between the extraction and consumption of fossil fuels and the Thomas Fire  which some climate scientists believe was made worse by climate change. “These are climate disasters  and they’re going to get worse and worse ” Ms. Marcario said. “We have an administration that isn’t paying any attention to that.” None Patagonia’s lawsuit against Mr. Trump is currently tied up in the courts. It has been consolidated with two other cases filed by separate groups  and the government has asked a judge in Washington to transfer the case to Utah. There is no deadline for that decision  and until then  all proceedings in the case are stayed. Hogan Lovells  which has 25 lawyers working the case on a pro bono basis  has billed $1.7 million in hours to date. In the meantime  the area originally protected by Bears Ears National Monument is available for commercial use  including drilling and mining  though there hasn’t yet been any new development. At Patagonia  Ms. Sheehy said that while the company would see its suit against the president through to the end  it had an expansive time horizon when it came to environmental protection. “These are all long fights ” she said. “We’re in this for 50 years  100 years.” None None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,business
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/business/t-mobile-sprint-john-legere.html,‘He’s a Pit Bull’: T-Mobile C.E.O. Is the Colorful Outlier of Wireless Advertisement Supported by None At the 2014 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas  T-Mobile’s chief executive  John Legere  crashed the AT&T party at the Venetian hotel. Wearing a black leather jacket and his customary pink T-Mobile T-shirt  Mr. Legere said he was just hoping to see the rapper Macklemore perform. None Since taking over T-Mobile in 2012  Mr. Legere has made a name for himself with those kinds of publicity stunts — promoting his own brand while undermining the competition. But now  Mr. Legere may have truly crashed the party. None Under the terms of the proposed deal  Mr. Legere would become chief executive of the combined company  which would keep the T-Mobile name. It’s a bold move  and one that illustrates Mr. Legere’s willingness to disrupt the status quo  even if he appears to have the weaker hand. “He wants to take on the titans of AT&T and Verizon ” said Steve Grasso  director of institutional sales at Stuart Frankel and a market analyst for CNBC  who knows Mr. Legere socially. “He’s a pit bull.” The combination of T-Mobile and Sprint has been years in the making  as both companies have sought to add scale and compete with their larger rivals. Yet the last time the companies formally attempted a deal  in 2014  it was Sprint that was planning to acquire T-Mobile. That deal fell apart in the face of regulatory scrutiny. And since then  Mr. Legere has managed to build T-Mobile’s business by flouting convention. Under his leadership  T-Mobile began offering unlimited data  reduced prices and less stringent contract commitments. When Mr. Legere took over in 2012  he was a very different executive  and T-Mobile was a very different company. T-Mobile was reeling from a failed attempt to sell itself to AT&T and struggling to distinguish itself from other low-cost carriers like Sprint and Metro PCS. Mr. Legere  who spent 20 years working at AT&T  was a conventional  if ambitious  telecommunications executive. “He was a finance guy ” said Dan Hesse  the former chief executive of Sprint  who was a mentor of Mr. Legere’s at AT&T. “The first time I saw John after he was named C.E.O. of T-Mobile  he was there in his suit.” That soon changed. In 2013  Mr. Legere was onstage at an event in Las Vegas with Joe Torre  the former manager of the Yankees  promoting a partnership between T-Mobile and Major League Baseball. When reporters asked him about the state of the wireless industry  he responded with a tirade about how badly customers were mistreated  and what he planned to do differently. None Soon  Mr. Legere  now 59  had a whole new look. He grew his hair to his shoulders. He wore company T-shirts wherever he went. He pulled on custom pink Converse sneakers emblazoned with the T-Mobile logo. Before long  the finance guy looked more like an aging rock star. None And on Twitter  he began hurling insults at competitors and tangling with rival C.E.O.s — including Sprint’s Marcelo Claure. None Offline  Mr. Legere also cultivated an eccentric image. He is a regular visitor to T-Mobile stores and call centers  where he delivers boisterous pep talks. At company meetings  he offers employees $100 if they will ask him a question in the form of a song. And in the office  he is fond of riding around on a Segway. “John has built a franchise around T-Mobile  which is in part his own ” said Stephen Scherr  head of the consumer and commercial banking division at Goldman Sachs  who has worked with Mr. Legere for more than a decade. But Mr. Legere has paired showmanship with results. During his tenure  T-Mobile has added subscribers and increased revenues and profits. “He’s also a great operator ” Mr. Scherr said. “He runs a really good business.” If Mr. Legere succeeds in finally joining T-Mobile and Sprint  the man who wanted to come off as the consummate outsider will have pulled off the ultimate insider move: a mega-merger to combine two rival companies and seize a greater share of a changing industry. None Under President Trump  antitrust enforcement has become unpredictable. The Justice Department has mounted a court fight against the proposed combination of AT&T and Time Warner  which do not directly compete with each other. At the same time  there appears to be little resistance to the proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox assets by Disney  a deal which would reduce competition in the film and television industry. Mr. Legere  who is sensitive to public perceptions  seems to have anticipated this moment. In January 2017  after Mr. Trump’s election but before his inauguration  Mr. Legere was asked about his view of the regulatory environment under the Trump administration. “It’s hard not to be excited ’’ he said  about regulatory views that would be “conducive to us significantly expanding our business.” None Mr. Legere knew from firsthand experience. In 2015  after Mr. Trump insulted the U.F.C. fighter Ronda Rousey on Twitter  Mr. Legere came to her defense. In the ensuing exchange  Mr. Legere said Mr. Trump wasn’t presidential material. “I am an undecided Republican ” Mr. Legere wrote. “Well not totally undecided  I know what I don’t want :)” But it seems that the prospect of a multibillion-dollar deal can heal old wounds. Mr. Legere has since deleted that tweet about the president. And on Sunday  Mr. Legere was making the rounds with Mr. Claure of Sprint  another old social media sparring partner  to talk up their alliance.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/business/adena-friedman-nasdaq-corner-office.html, How Nasdaq C.E.O. Adena Friedman Beat the Odds on Wall Street Advertisement Supported by corner office She grew up hanging around the trading floor with her father. Now she’s running a major stock exchange. How? She spoke up  and she got stuff done.  None It can be notoriously difficult for women to thrive on Wall Street. Adena Friedman says that hasn’t been the case for her.  None Today  Ms. Friedman is trying to make Nasdaq’s culture more collaborative  grapple with cryptocurrencies and create opportunities for more women to succeed in finance. She’s also overseeing Nasdaq’s continuing transformation from a stock exchange to a multifaceted company that provides technology to other exchanges around the world.  This interview  which was condensed and edited for clarity  was conducted at Nasdaq’s MarketSite location in Times Square. Tell me about your parents.  My father spent his entire career at T. Rowe Price and became the chief investment officer. I would go hang out down at the trading desk and draw on the walls.  My parents got married when they were still in college  so my mother did not graduate right away. She had kids  but then went back to college at Johns Hopkins. Then when I was 9  she decided to go to law school  and actually became the first woman partner in her law firm. So I got to see her really transform from being this awesome stay-at-home mom to being a combination of a great mom and a great career person  and my dad was really  really supportive of what she was doing. It was a formative thing for me  to see how she transformed herself. None It was a really important part of me growing up  being in an environment where being smart was celebrated. They constantly talked about going as far as you can go in your life.  I wanted to be an astronaut when I grew up  and our science teacher — who was a man — said: “O.K.  well  let’s work that out. Here are some things you can think about in terms of learning physics. Look at this great space camp you can go to.” It was not at all like  “Oh  that’s hard.” It was more like  “Great  let’s get you well positioned to be able to do that.” Did you always want to get into finance? I really wanted to do political science. I worked on a congressional campaign one summer and then worked on Capitol Hill for a summer. It was somewhat of a disillusioning experience realizing how policy really gets made. You kind of walk in with this idealistic view of “Of course your congressman’s going to represent all of your interests.” I came away saying  “Wow  progress is slow.” What drew you to Wall Street? In business school I really liked product management. As a product manager  you have to own the four P’s of marketing — product  placement  pricing and promotion. If you own the product  it’s like being the C.E.O. of your own little company. I didn’t think that I would be that excited to do that for consumer goods  but I would love to be able to do that for financial products. So I went to Nasdaq. You joined Nasdaq in 1993. What was it like being a woman on Wall Street back then?  There were not a lot of women in the office. But the man I worked for saw me as someone who was an M.B.A. grad. He would give me something to do  and I would go do it  and I would do it well. He never once made me feel at all different or disadvantaged by being a woman. I just got stuff done. When I got my first promotion I was actually pregnant. For him it was like: “Oh  that’s fine. You’ll be gone for three months  and you’ll come back.” He really just didn’t even factor it into his decision making. What advice do you give to women who feel like they aren’t receiving equal treatment? First of all  make sure you have a voice. I had this one woman that worked for me  and every time she had an idea she would whisper it into the room. So I took her aside  and I said: “Speak up. You are really  really smart. No more mousy voice. Get in the room and speak at the same tone as everyone else  and I can assure you your voice will be heard.” Next time she had an opinion  she spoke up  and everyone was like  “Wow  that’s a really good idea.” Then she was empowered to do it again and again.  And still  some women may face discrimination. What then?  If you really don’t feel you’re getting the opportunities that you should be getting  maybe you should look for a different place to work or a different person to work for. Then  of course  if you really feel like you’re not being treated properly  as a person  there should be many means for women to be able to voice that concern  to H.R.  to legal. When you rejoined Nasdaq after a stint at the Carlyle Group  you went from being a C.F.O. to being the C.E.O. Was that a difficult transition?  The C.F.O. role is actually the hardest role in the company. One minute you’re having to manage risk  and the next minute you’re having to advise your C.E.O. on how to take risk. What I found frustrating about the C.F.O. role is you’re not the ultimate decision maker. I prefer to be the risk taker. Most people know Nasdaq as the stock exchange where Facebook and Tesla trade  but that’s a small part of the business. What is Nasdaq today?  We are a great capital market ourselves. But we also provide technology to 96 other markets around the world. We are kind of the technology that powers the capital markets around the world today. Are you going to allow initial coin offerings on Nasdaq? You have to look at the blockchain and cryptocurrencies as two distinct concepts  two totally different things. The blockchain  as a technology  has the opportunity to create a lot more efficiency in the capital markets. You can create a perfect record of ownership and the transfer of ownership.  I think that the S.E.C. is taking the right actions to scrutinize in great detail the concept of an I.C.O. I.C.O.s as constructed today  outside the construct of a regulatory framework — that’s not something we’re getting involved in.  What’s your leadership style?  We have this process we call the light bulb versus the mandate. When we’re in a room and we want ideas to flow  including my crazy ideas sometimes  we say  “O.K.  let’s have some light bulbs.” It’s just an idea  could be a really bad one  but let’s put it on the table  let’s talk about it. But once we make a decision  or if there’s something that I really need the guys to just go do  I just say  “Guys  this is a mandate.” None We’ve had a couple of situations  even really recently  where we hadn’t brought any women into the interview process  and suddenly we did and were like  “Whoa  she is probably the best candidate for the job.” So it actually really does make a difference. None How has Wall Street changed for women in the past 10 or 15 years? Do you see a difference between now and then? I’ve had three very important sponsors of my career  all men. And it’s not like they sat there and had to do a lot to push  push  push me forward. They offered advice when I asked for it  and they gave me opportunity when they saw it  and that’s all they had to do. My career has been frankly an exemplary example of how women can succeed in Wall Street.  None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,business
https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/08/business/08reuters-autolus-ipo.html,UK Biotech Firm Autolus Joins CAR-T Rush With Nasdaq IPO Filing Advertisement Supported by None LONDON — Autolus Therapeutics  a small British company developing cell therapy treatments  is to join the swelling ranks of listed biotech companies using the new anti-cancer technology with a planned IPO on Nasdaq. The group said on Tuesday it had filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a proposed initial public offering (IPO) under the ticker symbol AUTL. The number of its American depositary shares to be sold in the IPO and the pricing terms have not yet been determined. Autolus is developing chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) treatments to fight blood cancers and  hopefully  also solid tumours. The first two CAR-T treatments from Novartis and Gilead Sciences won U.S. approval last year for rare blood cancer and a number of start-up companies  as well as large drugmakers  are investing heavily in the space. Autolus  which was spun out from University College London in 2014 and uses cell technology pioneered by Dr. Martin Pule  is aiming to develop next-generation CAR-T treatments that it hopes will have an edge over the first wave of therapies. Its backers include Syncona  Woodford Investment Management and Arix Bioscience.   (Reporting by Ben Hirschler  editing by Jason Neely) Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,business
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/business/dealbook/stock-market-trump-taxes.html,Nasdaq Hits 6 000 as Markets Rise on Tax Overhaul Optimism Advertisement Supported by None Propelled by the skyrocketing returns of large technology stocks  the Nasdaq composite index pushed past the 6 000 level for the first time in its history. The sharp move was driven by a confluence of positive news developments  including a market-friendly outcome in the first round of France’s presidential election over the weekend and reports that President Trump will put forward a plan to slash corporate taxes to 15 percent. None But it has been the technology-laden index of 100 Nasdaq stocks that has delivered the far superior performance  rising 14 percent this year — more than twice the gains of the Dow and S.&P. 500. For the day  the Nasdaq closed at 6 025.49  up 0.7 percent for the day. Driving this performance has been the persistent run-up in stocks such as Apple  Facebook  Google and Amazon  which together now comprise about a third of the index  as measured by QQQ  the $43 billion exchange traded fund that tracks Nasdaq stocks. Apple  Amazon and Facebook are up over 20 percent for the year  with Google having increased by 12 percent. The Dow closed at 20 996.12  up 232.23 points  or 1.12 percent  while the broader S.&P. 500 ended at 2 388.61  up 14.46 points  or 0.61 percent. None Analysts have pointed out  though  that compared with past manias — in particular the dot-com bubble — the recent surge in technology stocks stands on firmer ground. “In 2000  the price-to-earnings ratio for Nasdaq was 170 — today it is trading at 26 times ” said Charlie Bilello  the director of research at Pension Partners  an investment advisory firm  referring to a common gauge for measuring stock valuations. “That is not cheap  but it’s not crazy. We are definitely not at the level where the average guy quits his job to trade stocks.” That may be true  but there is no doubt that the explosion in size of these stocks has taken many market participants by surprise  even if it is accepted that their corporate fundamentals are superior. None None Indeed  the booming returns of these index-heavy stocks has been a cause of intense frustration for portfolio managers and hedge funds who charge their investors steep fees to uncover hidden gems in the stock market. That is because unless they have a large part of their portfolio in fast growing (and richly valued) stocks like Amazon  Facebook and Apple  they are going to lag their benchmarks and lose money to cheaper exchange traded funds that track these indexes and provide maximum exposure to these stocks. None “The mega cap growth stocks in Nasdaq have had a strong start to 2017  and many active managers have been underweight ” said Todd Rosenbluth  an exchange traded fund specialist at CFRA Research. “People underestimate the fact that large companies continue to get larger. And the answer is — yes they can.” None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,business
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/business/tech-stocks-tesla-nvidia.html,Technology Companies Drag Stock Markets Down Again Advertisement Supported by None Technology stocks helped propel the nine-year bull market. Optimistic investors piled into the shares  hoping to grab a piece of the profits from industries such as social media  autonomous driving  video streaming and artificial intelligence. Now  that confidence is evaporating. Investors pummeled technology company stocks again on Tuesday  knocking the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index down 1.7 percent. The Nasdaq composite  laden with technology stocks  sank 2.9 percent after a flurry of bad news about specific companies metastasized into a broad retreat from technology stocks. None The news sent Nvidia shares plunging 7.8 percent  the sharpest decline of any company in the S.&P. None The investigation adds to the financial pressure Tesla is already facing  as it burns through cash and struggles to accelerate production of its Model 3 electric vehicles. Citing those challenges  Moody’s Investors Service downgraded its rating on the company’s bonds after markets closed Tuesday. Across the technology industry  investors are suddenly anxious that intensified regulatory scrutiny is going to hurt profits and therefore stock prices. That spells trouble for the markets because tech companies have long been investor favorites. Facebook  Amazon  Netflix and Google’s parent company  Alphabet  have delivered some of the best returns to investors in recent years. Those days are gone. None Most of the major technology companies were big losers Tuesday. Netflix fell 6.1 percent  its sharpest decline since July 2016. Alphabet and Microsoft both dropped 4.6 percent. The hammering of technology stocks is only the most recent source of market turbulence. Since February  a diverse crop of worries — such as the prospects of central banks raising interest rates quickly and concerns of a trade war derailing the economy — have unnerved investors. After years of being placid  markets have been on a roller coaster  routinely rising or falling by more than 1 percent in a single day. Because technology stocks until recently had been on such a tear  their recent stumbles are all the more painful for the broader markets. Since the start of the bull market in March 2009  the price of tech shares has soared more than 460 percent. The overall S.&P. index  by contrast  has gained 290 percent. The S.&P. and other indexes are weighted by the market values of their constituent companies. In 2009  the tech sector made up 17.5 percent of the S.&P. 500. Today  that figure is more than 25 percent. As a result  the recent declines in the values of tech stocks have dragged the overall indexes down with them.

Her predecessor  Robert Greifeld  will become chairman of the company’s board  replacing Borje Ekholm. For Ms. Friedman  47  the promotion comes at a time of consolidation within the world of market operators and of rapid changeover in technology. Under Mr. Greifeld  Nasdaq expanded from a single stock exchange to a global markets operator that now trades stocks and options  including through acquisitions of counterparts  like OMX of Sweden  in the United States and abroad. None In an interview  Ms. Friedman said that her job as chief executive would be to keep Nasdaq on top of the shifting landscape. “Nasdaq today is a world-class market operator and technology leader ” she said. Since joining Nasdaq in 1993  Ms. Friedman has rose steadily through the company  she has served as the head of data products and as chief financial officer. Her career took a different path in 2011 when she joined the investment firm Carlyle Group as its chief financial officer  ahead of its initial public offering — on the Nasdaq market. Ms. Friedman rejoined Nasdaq two years ago as president and heir apparent to Mr. Greifeld. She added the title of chief operating officer in December. The timing of her promotion was not a surprise to analysts: Mr. Greifeld’s contract was set to expire in February  and the market operator’s board had long been working on a succession plan. “I’ve had the opportunity to watch Adena grow and develop over the last 14 years  and can confidently say she is the right person for this role and is unquestionably as passionate about the company’s future as I am ” Mr. Greifeld said in a statement. “Adena has played an instrumental role in building this organization into one of the most innovative leaders  with a tremendous disruptive spirit. I know she will do exceptionally well for clients  shareholders and employees.” Ms. Friedman will also become one of the highest-ranking women executives in the finance world. “I have been measured on my merit and on my accomplishments ” she said  adding that she hoped other women would see Wall Street as becoming more inclusive.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index ended 0.1 percent higher after spending most of the day in negative territory. Italy's FTSE MIB closed 1.6 percent lower amid worries about political turmoil in the euro zone's third-largest economy. Italian banks took the most off the index  losing 2.1 percent. State-controlled oil major Eni was down 2.6 percent.  ""It's not a good day for Italian assets. Markets are starting to feel the pressure of elections "" said Carlo Franchini  head of institutional clients at Italy's Banca Ifigest.  President Sergio Mattarella called on Monday for Italy's bickering parties to rally behind a ""neutral government."" Italy's two largest parties  the far-right League and anti-establishment 5-Star Movement  opposed that idea  raising the likelihood of an immediate return to the polls. The Italian stock market has outperformed its European peers this year  but a number of analysts warned that political risk was not priced into the market. On Monday  the FTSE MIB ended at its highest since October 2009. Elsewhere in Europe  first-quarter corporate earnings and mergers and acquisitions prompted sharp individual price moves while investors prepared for Donald Trump's decision on whether to withdraw the U.S. from the Iran nuclear agreement.  The announcement is expected after the market close and could disrupt global oil supplies. The price of crude is near its highest in more than three years.  Shares in Danish hearing aid maker William Demant were the worst performers of the STOXX  falling 9.5 percent after warning that lower demand would weigh on sales. German postal and logistics group Deutsche Post DHL missed first-quarter profit expectations and saw its shares fall 7 percent. Earnings also missed forecasts at staffing group Adecco  and its shares fell 5.1 percent.  Unilever  however  advanced 1.8 percent as it announced a 6 billion-euro share buyback.  In London  mergers and acquisitions helped the FTSE close flat in percentage terms.

""Currency depreciation is already arresting the under-performance of the region's universe of blue chips most dependent upon external markets "" said Christopher Potts  head of economics and strategy at the European bank.

https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/07/business/07reuters-berkshire-buffett-cnbc.html,"Buffett Bashes Bitcoin as Thriving on Mystique  Favors Stocks Advertisement Supported by None NEW YORK — Billionaire investor Warren Buffett on Monday said buyers of bitcoin  which he has characterized as ""rat poison squared "" thrive on the hope they'll find other people who will pay more for it. Likening bitcoin demand to the tulip bulb mania in 17th century Holland  Buffett  the chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc  said the mystique behind the cryptocurrency has caused its price to surge. ""If you don't understand it  you get much more excited "" Buffett said on CNBC television. ""People like to speculate  they like to gamble."" He said investors now are much better off owning U.S. stocks  whose prices are elevated but not in a ""bubble "" and it would take a ""nanosecond"" for him to choose stocks over 10- or 30-year U.S. government bonds now yielding around 3 percent. Charlie Munger  Buffett's longtime business partner and a Berkshire vice chairman  is also no bitcoin fan  describing it as ""worthless artificial gold."" He likened it to Oscar Wilde's definition of fox hunting  calling it ""the pursuit of the uneatable by the unspeakable."" Buffett  87  and Munger  94  spoke two days after they presided at Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha  Nebraska  which was expected to have drawn more than 40 000 people. It was the first meeting since Berkshire elevated longtime executives Greg Abel and Ajit Jain to vice chairmen  making them top contenders to replace Buffett as chief executive. Buffett said their promotions have been ""very  very good"" for the company. Berkshire has said its board knows who would become chief executive if the need arose. One of its members  Microsoft Corp co-founder Bill Gates  said on CNBC ""it's not a horse race"" between Abel and Jain. Buffett renewed his desire to spend some of Berkshire’s low-yielding cash on a major acquisition. He said he would be happier if Berkshire had $30 billion of cash and equivalents  not the $108.6 billion it reported holding at the end of March. ""If a $100 billion deal came along that Charlie and I really liked  we’d get it done "" he said. Buffett revealed last week Berkshire had bought about 75 million additional Apple Inc shares in the first quarter  adding to the 165.3 million it already owns. It now has a 5 percent stake in the iPhone maker  trailing only Vanguard Group and BlackRock Inc. Buffett said he would be happy to see the Apple share price fall if it would spur repurchases.  Munger  meanwhile  said Berkshire may have been ""a little too restrained"" in buying Apple  saying ""it's reasonably priced and strong."" He added: ""I wished we owned more of it.""  Buffett also said the list of CEO candidates has been ""narrowed down"" for the healthcare venture between Berkshire  Amazon.com and JPMorgan Chase. He said choosing the CEO will be ""by far the most difficult decision we will make.""

https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/04/world/asia/ap-financial-markets.html,"Stocks Jump  With Buffett Helping Apple to New Highs Advertisement Supported by None NEW YORK — U.S. stocks made up for a shaky week with a strong finish Friday as Apple led a rally in technology companies. The tech giant hit an all-time high after Warren Buffett said he'd made another big investment. Stocks got off to a mixed start after trade talks between the U.S. and China ended with few signs of progress. The April jobs report showed that hiring continued at a solid clip and wages continued to grow at a slow pace. Apple surged after Buffett said Berkshire Hathaway bought 75 million shares during the first quarter. Alphabet  Cisco Systems and other technology companies rose  and retailers  banks  and household goods makers also rallied. Investors also cheered strong first-quarter results from companies including Shake Shack and Activision Blizzard. ""We went into this earnings season with very high expectations "" said Quincy Krosby  chief markets strategist for Prudential Financial. ""When you go in with such high expectations  you expect near perfection."" The S&P 500 index climbed 33.69 points  or 1.3 percent  to 2 663.42.

The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks gained 19.05 points  or 1.2 percent  to 1 565.60. Overall  stocks have taken small losses in choppy trading over the last two weeks. But for Apple  this was the best week in six and a half years. Apple rose 3.9 percent to $183.83 after Warren Buffett told CNBC his company boosted its investment in Apple to more than 240 million shares altogether. Buffett told CNBC about the purchase ahead of Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting this weekend. Berkshire stock rose 2.1 percent to $195.64. Apple climbed 13.3 percent for the week after it reported solid quarterly results and investors were pleased with its forecast of solid iPhone sales  which came as a relief. It also raised its dividend and announced a big stock repurchase. Companies have done well in the first quarter  but stocks haven't necessarily followed suit as investors worried about the U.S.-China trade spat  rising interest rates  and other issues. But on Friday investors responded. After better-than-expected reports  burger chain Shake Shack surged 18 percent to $55.95 while music streaming company Pandora Media advanced 19.8 percent to $6.89. Video game maker Activision Blizzard gained 4.5 percent to $69.84. The stock had dipped Thursday afternoon after Activision's results were released early. U.S. employers stepped up hiring modestly in April  and the hiring estimate from March was revised higher. That's evident the economy remains resilient even though some businesses are concerned about a possible trade war. While many employers say it's difficult to find qualified workers  they have yet to significantly boost pay in most industries  a trend that continued last month. ""That may not be good for Main Street  but it's what Wall Street wanted to see "" said Krosby  of Prudential. The Trump administration asked China to reduce its trade deficit with the U.S. by $200 billion by the end of 2020  striking an assertive stance in talks aimed at averting a trade war between the world's largest economies. It also wants China to immediately stop providing subsidies to certain industries listed in a key industrial plan and end some of its policies related to technology transfers  a key source of tension underlying the dispute. While the trade tensions have rattled investors  many market watchers think the two sides will eventually come to a deal that doesn't disrupt trade much. Engineering and construction company Fluor plunged after it slashed its profit forecast because a gas-fired power project suffered ""continued challenges."" The company took an unexpected loss in the first quarter and now expects a profit of $2.10 to $2.50 per share for the year  down from 2$3.10 to $3.50 per share. The stock dropped 22.4 percent to $45.76. Bond prices rose early  but later gave up that gain. The yield on the 2-year Treasury note rose to 2.49 percent from 2.48 percent. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained at 2.95 percent. That helped banks recover from an early loss. Lower bond yields mean lower rates for mortgages and other types of loans  which reduces profits for banks. Companies that pay big dividends didn't rise as much as the rest of the market. Benchmark U.S. crude rose 1.9 percent to $69.72 per barrel in New York. Brent crude  the international standard  gained 1.7 percent to $74.87 per barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline jumped 1.3 percent to $2.11 a gallon. Heating oil climbed 2 percent to $2.15 a gallon. Natural gas lost 0.6 percent to $2.71 per 1 000 cubic feet. Gold gained 0.2 percent to $1 314.70 an ounce. Silver added 0.4 percent to $16.52 an ounce. Copper rose 0.2 percent to $3.09 a pound. The dollar fell to 109.11 yen from 109.73 yen. The euro fell to $1.1962 from $1.1993. Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.9 percent and the DAX in Germany added 1 percent. France's CAC 40 gained 0.3 percent.

https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/04/30/us/ap-financial-markets.html,"Stocks Close Lower  as Telecom Companies Weigh on Market Advertisement Supported by None NEW YORK — U.S. stocks fell moderately on Monday  giving up an early gain  but still ended April higher. It was the first monthly increase for the market since January as company earnings have come in better than many expected. Indexes jumped in the early going following news of several buyout deals and more strong earnings reports  but sagged after lunchtime  weighed down by losses for telecom stocks and other areas of the market. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 148.04 points  or 0.6 percent  to 24 163.15. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 21.86 points  or 0.8 percent  to 2 648.05 and the Nasdaq composite lost 53.53 points  or 0.8 percent  to 7 066.27. Dow member McDonald's jumped 5.8 percent to $167.83 after it reported healthier profit and revenue than analysts expected for the first three months of the year. Sales at its restaurants open more than a year were much stronger than Wall Street had forecast McDonald's joined the wave of companies to report big earnings growth for the first quarter  which has been better than analysts expected. Just over half the companies in the S&P 500 have reported their earnings for the first three months of the year  and they're on pace to deliver overall growth of 23 percent  according to FactSet. That would be the strongest showing since the summer of 2010. ""It's been phenomenal "" said Phil Orlando  chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors. ""Corporate earnings are doing better. Economic growth is doing better  and I think the market is begrudgingly allowing those numbers to work their way into share prices."" The S&P 500 has been whipping higher and lower in recent months  hurt by worries about higher interest rates and the possibility of a trade war. But the index is ending April up a modest 0.3 percent  compared to the 2.7 percent loss it had in March and 3.9 percent loss it had in February. At the center of the buyout news was Sprint and T-Mobile. The pair announced a $26.5 billion deal to merge following years of consideration for a combination. Investors are unsure whether this attempt will get the necessary approvals from U.S. regulators. Sprint dropped 13.7 percent to $5.61  and T-Mobile lost 6.2 percent to $60.51. Other telecom stocks also fell  with Verizon giving up 4.3 percent to $49.35 and AT&T falling 1 percent to $32.70. Oil company Andeavor was the biggest gainer in the S&P 500 after Marathon Petroleum said it will buy the refiner and pipeline owner for more than $23 billion. Andeavor  which used to be called Tesoro  soared 13 percent to $138.32. And DCT Industrial Trust  a logistics real-estate company  gained 11.6 percent to $65.57 after Prologis  an owner of distribution centers and other logistics real estate  agreed on Sunday to buy it in an all-stock deal. Besides being the heart of earnings reporting season for companies  this week will also feature a policy meeting for the Federal Reserve on interest rates. The Fed will announce its decision on Wednesday. On Friday  the government releases its jobs report  which is usually the most anticipated economic report of each month. Benchmark U.S. crude rose 47 cents to $68.57 per barrel. Brent crude  the international standard  gained 53 cents to $75.17. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note dipped to 2.94 percent from 2.96 percent late Friday. The dollar rose to 109.29 Japanese yen from 109.02 yen late Friday. The euro fell to $1.2082 from $1.2121  and the British pound dipped to $1.3748 from $1.3785. Gold fell $4.20 to $1 319.20 an ounce  silver fell 10 cents to $16.40 an ounce and copper rose less than 1 cent to $3.074 a pound. Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ",business
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/13/business/finding-emerging-markets-stocks-with-social-consciences.html,Finding Emerging Markets Stocks With Social Consciences Advertisement Supported by None Until recently  investors interested in emerging market funds had few ways of singling out companies with standout environmental  social and governance records. That has begun to change over the last several years  as the popularity of investing with an eye to these issues has surged. There are now 10 mutual funds and exchange-traded-funds that invest in stocks in emerging markets while making environmental  social and governance performance an explicit part of their mission  according to Morningstar. None For its first several years  the E.S.G. index outperformed its peer benchmark. Mr. Varco wanted to determine whether that was luck. He crunched the data and concluded that selecting companies based on nonfinancial factors had helped. Simply put  the E.S.G. index did better because the companies within it appeared  on average  to be better run. “There’s yet to be a year where the standard index did better ” he said. None People who opt for funds of this sort should understand that their performance will diverge from that of well-known emerging-markets benchmarks  said Todd L. Rosenbluth  director of E.T.F. and mutual fund research at CFRA  an investment research firm. “Because the holdings and the weightings differ  the performance is likely to differ ” he said. “E.S.G. strategies tend to have hefty weightings in technology stocks. So when tech is in favor  as it was in 2017  that will help them. If we hit a time when energy or old-line industrials shine  they won’t perform as well.” None None None Over the last five years  emerging markets have chugged upward  with MSCI’s conventional index gaining an annualized average of 4.99 percent. In the first quarter  the index gained 1.42 percent. MSCI’s Emerging Markets E.S.G. Leaders Index has outpaced its peer — rising an annualized average of 8.6 percent over the last five years  though only 1.01 percent in the first quarter. When Mr. Varco  of Cambridge Associates  did his study  he didn’t dig into precisely why companies in the E.S.G. index might excel or  conversely  why ones in the conventional index might lag. But he said one reason might be that state-owned enterprises  like Brazil’s Petrobras  where a prominent bribery scandal has implicated dozens of government officials  loom large in the standard index. These outfits are often not run as well as their nonstate kin  he said. Managers of actively managed funds echoed his assessment. None None “The Chinese state doesn’t work for you ” he said. “It works for itself. Its goals and incentives aren’t aligned with those of minority shareholders.” Two Chinese state-owned enterprises — China Mobile and China Construction Bank — are among the top 10 constituents of the standard index. Put differently  the problem with state-run companies  besides potential political agendas  is governance. They don’t have procedures in place  as developed-world public companies typically do  to ensure that minority investors are treated fairly and have access to all the information they need about company operations  investments and finances. None “For me  the emphasis is sustainability ” he said. “Companies that plan for the future  with adequate infrastructure and R.&D.  and look to build long-term relationships with all their stakeholders  I believe they’ll ultimately have higher returns.” None The case for investing in the emerging world can be boiled down to a word: growth. Compared with developed countries  emerging ones are  on average  growing faster  and they are pulling hundreds of millions of people into the middle class for the first time. That’s giving rise to new companies and creating huge new markets for existing ones  said Binu George  portfolio strategist for the emerging markets team at GMO  an asset management firm. “There are 24 emerging-market countries ” he said. “In those countries and their stocks  there’s a massive opportunity for you to make money.” With that faster growth comes greater risk: On average  the returns of emerging markets stocks roller coaster more than those of developed market ones. “The asset class is incredibly volatile  and yet there are still many great businesses in the emerging world ” said Mr. Eidelman of the JPMorgan fund. Over time  patience — and attention to environmental  social and governance factors — can pay off  leading to superior performance  he said. “The time frame really matters. If you’re looking to own a business for a long time — not just trade a stock — then factors around how that business interacts with all of its stakeholders become much more important. If you’re just trading monthly  the fact that you think the management is dodgy might not matter.” For someone committed to so-called socially responsible investing  including a relatively small allocation — say 5 or 10 percent of a diversified portfolio — to this niche can make sense  added Mr. Rosenbluth of CFRA. “E.S.G. factors are perhaps even more relevant outside the U.S.  especially governance ” he said. “This sounds obvious  but in less developed countries  the companies have less developed governance. By investing in ones that are providing better governance  you’re encouraging other companies to act more responsibly.” Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,business

The banking sector was a bright spot  however  with gains in RBS following a multi-billion dollar deal to settle a U.S. investigation of the bank's bond sales  and a solid update from Italy's biggest bank UniCredit helping limit losses on the pan-European STOXX 600  which ended just 0.1 percent lower. BT shares fell more than 7 percent after saying it was cutting 13 000 jobs  the latest attempt by Britain's biggest telecoms group to rebuild after an accounting scandal and a downturn in trading. Traders said its latest update showed a disappointing guidance  while Jefferies analysts highlighted that the company missed out on the opportunity of announcing a bolder move of fibre roll out  while job cuts were bigger then expected. ""No evidence of inflection in results or mindset "" said Jefferies. RBS rallied 3.8 percent after it agreed to pay a smaller-than-expected $4.9 billion to resolve a U.S. investigation into its sale of mortgage-backed securities. Analysts  who had estimated the U.S. could impose a fine of up to $12 billion  said the bank could reinstate a dividend. Gains in RBS helped the UK's FTSE rise 0.5 percent  outperforming other European bourses after the Bank of England's decision to keep rates on hold sparked a drop in sterling. Still in banks  UniCredit rose 1.8 percent after it posted its best first-quarter result since 2007  topping forecasts with a 1.1 billion euro net profit thanks to lower-than-expected loan losses.  Italy's FTSE MIB fell 1 percent as bond yields jumped on an increased possibility that a government of anti-establishment parties will take power.  Some of the biggest movers on the STOXX also included precious metals miner Randgold  down 7 percent after its quarterly profit fell  while Next rose more than 6 percent after a strong outlook and trading update. Utilities were a weak spot  down 0.9 percent to lead sectoral losers in Europe  weighed by a disappointing update at Italy's Enel.  Oil stocks took a breather after hitting their highest level in more than 3-1/2 years in the previous session after the price of oil jumped on the back of the U.S. quitting a nuclear deal with Iran.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/25/opinion/north-korea-south-korea-peace.html,North Korea’s Phony Peace Ploy Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor None Mr. Eberstadt is a founding director of the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea. None None None None None None None And so the North  rather than committing to a legally binding (and potentially destabilizing) peace treaty  is likely to do again what it has gotten away with in previous meetings with the South: dangle aspirational goals in jointly signed  but totally unenforceable  official statements. None None Not to put too fine a point on it: All of these deals were then trash-canned. The North Korean promises in them were worthless  indeed deceitful. These agreements only seemed to hold force until  well  they no longer did  when Pyongyang unilaterally decided to ignore  violate or repudiate them. None None Why  given the precedents? Because the Sunshine Policy is something of a secular religion in South Korea — at least among its adherents  who include main players in the current government — and  like all faiths  it is immune to empirical falsification. Sunshiners also seem to be convinced that only they can coax the North onto the path of common sense. And let’s not underestimate the political psychopathology of appeasement: People grow weary of the prospect of endless conflict with an implacable enemy and want to believe in solutions even if there are none. (Western Europe suffered a similar condition regarding the Soviet Union in the 1970s and ’80s.) The problem is that North Korea can walk away from its peace promises at any time. And when it eventually does  it will be able to blame whomever it wishes for this tragic result — potentially polarizing politics in South Korea  igniting tensions in Seoul’s alliance with Washington or fracturing the loose coalition of governments that rallied around sanctions against it. In the meantime  Pyongyang will hold the other parties hostage to the fear that if any of its new demands aren’t met  it will quit the peace process. None South Korean officials say that any permanent peace deal will be conditioned on the North’s denuclearization and that the North has agreed to that term. Only  the two governments do not agree on what “denuclearization” means. The South  and its allies  have in mind a complete  irreversible and verifiable process under which the North would forgo all of its nuclear weapons. The North tends to talk instead of the “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula ” which starts with cutting the South’s ties with its nuclear ally  the United States. And when it comes to denuclearization at home  Pyongyang frames the matter as an arms-control question: If America reduces its arsenal  so will we. Maybe. North Korea is a fearsome adversary. Let’s not play pretend-diplomacy with it. Nicholas Eberstadt is a political economist at the American Enterprise Institute. None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,business
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/11/opinion/why-reward-bullies.html,Why Do We Reward Bullies? Advertisement Supported by None Mr. Brooks is the president of the American Enterprise Institute. None Over the decades since that time  my position on conductors has softened (a little)  but my position on bullies has not. And I believe a big majority of the population shares this antipathy. Witness the box-office success of movies like “Horrible Bosses” and “Revenge of the Nerds ” in which bullies get their comeuppance. Consider also the frequent anti-bullying public service efforts  the latest of which is the first lady Melania Trump’s “Be Best” campaign. So it is mystifying that the ultimate market-based phenomenon in a democracy — political discourse — is currently dominated by this despised character trait. From television to social media to everyday politics at the highest level  we see the powerful belittling  maligning and mocking those with lower status. If we hate bullies  why are they rewarded in the public sphere with fame  attention and even electoral success? Why aren’t they repudiated? None Second  people are  paradoxically  attracted to bullies. In her book “The Allure of Toxic Leaders ” the social scientist Jean Lipman-Blumen shows that people complain about political dictators and tyrannical executives yet nearly always remain loyal out of a primordial admiration for power and need for security in an uncertain world. In the orchestra world  there is a joke about a viola player who for years is singled out for abuse and torment by the conductor. One day  he comes home from rehearsal to find his house burned to the ground. The police on the scene tell him that it’s arson and that there is evidence that the culprit is none other than the conductor. Asked if he has any questions  the violist thinks for a moment and asks  softly  “The maestro came to my house?” The third explanation is simple acquiescence. In a famous study published in 1999 in the Journal of Adolescence  three psychologists investigated how children act when they witness an act of bullying. Hundreds of schoolchildren were videotaped on the playground  and nearly 200 bullying incidents were recorded. Bullies love audiences  and in more than half of the cases  two or more peers were present in addition to the bully and victim. And how did the peers react? Twenty-one percent joined the bully  while 25 percent defended the victim. The rest — 54 percent — watched the incident passively  neither joining in nor defending the victim. Adults don’t seem to behave much differently when it comes to political bullying. Whether it is a political speech or comedy routine  egregious bullying is usually met with a shrug. Hey  what are you going to do? Maybe it doesn’t matter. Sticks and stones. In his Nobel Peace Prize lecture  Theodore Roosevelt noted  “We despise and abhor the bully  the brawler  the oppressor  whether in private or public life.” However  he continued with this bracing passage: “But we despise no less the coward and the voluptuary. No man is worth calling a man who will not fight rather than submit to infamy or see those that are dear to him suffer wrong.” Roosevelt was talking about standing up for one’s allies (“those that are dear to him”)  not about defending strangers. Fair enough. But ask yourself  who exactly are your allies? If you are friends with someone with whom you disagree politically  is this person not more your ally than some comedian  politician or Twitter troll who shares your politics? If so  shouldn’t you stand up for him or her before a bully  even if that bully shares your political views? Bullying is a demand-driven and inaction-driven phenomenon: It requires an eager audience or neutral bystanders. So don’t blame the host of the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner or the president of the United States. The problem is that we are becoming a nation of cowards and voluptuaries  either egging on or sitting passively as abuse and contempt take over our political discourse. If you hate it  stand up. I saw that happen only one time in the orchestra. A guest conductor was browbeating us in rehearsal and singling out individuals for abuse. An oboe player finally stood up and said  “With all due respect  Maestro  I think I speak for all of us when I say that the problem is not us  but you.” The conductor kicked him out of the rehearsal. For the rest of us  he was a hero. Arthur C. Brooks is the president of the American Enterprise Institute and a contributing opinion writer.

Advertisement Supported by None None Now the cheering has stopped. None Central to Mr. Xi’s plan is that it will allow foreign automakers to own Chinese factories  instead of working through a 50-50 Chinese partner  as is currently required. But auto executives in Beijing said they were comfortable with the current system. “It would be crazy to think you can do it all yourself  in a market that is so different ” said Trevor Worthington  Ford’s vice president for product development in Asia and the Pacific. None Mr. Xi’s plan to further open up China’s auto market was seen as a potential olive branch. It calls for phasing out by 2022 the Beijing government’s requirement that any foreign automaker that wants to make cars in China do so through a 50-50 joint venture with a Chinese car company. For makers of electric cars  the requirement would end this year. He also said that China would reduce its 25 percent tariff on imported cars  without offering details. The plan could help companies setting up new factories  especially upstarts like the electric vehicle company Tesla Motors  which has big ambitions in the world’s largest market for new cars. But established carmakers like Daimler  Volkswagen and Ford said at the auto show on Wednesday that they planned to keep their joint ventures the way they were. The companies have already moved their production and auto parts supply chains to China. And foreign auto companies have found making cars in China for local drivers quite profitable. “We will maintain the structure as we have today ” said Rupert Stadler  the chairman of Audi  the luxury arm of Volkswagen of Germany. Referring to Audi’s two joint ventures in China  he added  “For us it is very clear: We will  in the long run  have two feet on the ground in China.” None “We hope things may change ” said Jochem Heizmann  the president and chief executive of Volkswagen Group China. “At the end  this limits competition  this limits innovation.” They also cited China’s ambitious program to use state support to build up world-beating competitors in electric and self-driving cars  among other emerging technologies  a program called Made in China 2025. China also requires that electric cars be manufactured under brand names that are partly owned by Chinese partners. Peter Fleet  the president of Ford Motor’s Asia and Pacific operations  said the company already planned to sell electric cars in China through a joint venture under an inexpensive local brand that would not carry its famous blue oval logo. Still  he said  he thought the rule might be erased once China eliminates the requirement that electric cars also be produced by joint ventures in China. “That’s some of the detail we’ve yet to see ” he said.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/14/us/san-francisco-earthquake-film.html,Found Footage Offers a New Glimpse at 1906 San Francisco Earthquake Advertisement Supported by None None On Saturday night  a small crowd filled a 120-seat theater in Fremont  Calif.  to watch a movie unlike any other on the big screen  one that offers a fresh look at a tragic chapter in American history. None None “It’s quite a bookend to the earlier film where you see the activity down Market Street  only in a different light because everything is devastated ” Mr. Kiehn said.  Less than a decade ago  his research revealed that the earlier Miles Brothers movie was recorded not in 1905  as was long believed  but just four days before the earthquake. The new footage  which he painstakingly digitized  was recorded just a few weeks later  he said. For the first five or so minutes  the newly found film takes viewers on a trip similar to the one in the earlier Miles Brothers production  Mr. Kiehn said. Unlike that movie  the camera in the new one occasionally pans from side to side to reveal the rubble lining Market Street  San Francisco’s main artery.  Soon  the landmark Ferry Building comes into view  its scaffolding offering a clue to the date. A photograph marked April 22 shows no such support structure  while one dated May 3 shows more scaffolding than appears in the film  suggesting the recording was made sometime in between  Mr. Kiehn said. The movie then cuts to a different view of the Ferry Building site  panning back to Market Street  where wagons are lined up for passage across the bay. “You can even see a military guard with a bayoneted rifle standing post to control the crowds and there’s dozens and dozens of these wagons just waiting there ” Mr. Kiehn said. “You can see all the devastation in the background.” The latter portion of the film shows buildings being demolished with explosives. In a final scene  a crowd gathered to watch one such blast with the occasional bystander turning to look at the camera  which was still a novelty in 1906. That final stretch of the footage is tinted red  a kind of silent film special effect  Mr. Kiehn said. “In the early days  they would tint the film to kind of give a little color to the image ” he said. “Traditionally  red would be fire and night scenes would be tinted blue and they would have other colors to indicate some kind of mood.” The film’s recent journey from obscurity began about two years ago. Around that time  David F. Silver  a Bay Area dealer of antique and vintage cameras  met a man selling the reel  which was in particularly good condition and featured scenes that Mr. Silver didn’t recognize. After an inspection — and a brief panic when the seller held the highly flammable nitrate film perilously close to a light — Mr. Silver decided to buy it. “It’s the kind of treasure that I look for ” he said. None One of the members of the group  Nick Wright  reached out to help and eventually connected Mr. Silver with his brother  Jason Wright  a dealer of antique photographs based in England  who agreed to buy the reel from Mr. Silver.  “I was kind of secretly hoping it was going to be this long-lost Miles Brothers film  so I took a chance on it ” Mr. Wright said. If it was what he had hoped  he wanted to preserve the film  Mr. Wright said. So he contacted Mr. Kiehn  who was featured on a 2010 “60 Minutes” segment about the pre-earthquake film.  None The recovered film was shown publicly for the first time this weekend in three sold-out shows at the Edison Theater  a century-old venue restored by the Niles Essanay Silent Film Museum  where Mr. Kiehn is a film historian. The movie will be played again in early June at the 1 400-seat Castro Theater during the San Francisco Silent Film Festival. Mr. Wright said he plans to post at least some of the video online and will keep an archival copy for himself and share another with the Library of Congress. He wasn’t sure what he’ll do with reel itself  he said. “It’s been digitized  it’s been put down on safety film ” he said. “So I feel good that it’s been done. It’s been saved now.” None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,business

Here’s what we’re watching: • Does Amazon have its shipping costs under control? • What will come out of the Merkel-Trump meeting? • Why Deutsche Bank was so late to make necessary cuts. • More complaints have emerged about NBC News’s response to harassment allegations. None Amazon’s shipping costs have suddenly become a hot subject  not just to President Trump  but also to the 100 million people who have Amazon Prime. Higher shipping costs are a reason Amazon is raising the cost of Prime membership to $119 a year from $99. Advertisement But a 20 percent hike is a lot for even a popular service  and it could turn customers off. So why did Amazon do it? The e-commerce giant’s results provide some clues. Advertisement Members of Prime get free shipping  though their membership fees partially pay for that perk. As the Prime program covers more goods  it’s getting more expensive for Amazon. “Our two-day shipping  it’s now available on over 100 million items  up from 20 million as recently as 2014 ” Brian T. Olsavsky  Amazon’s C.F.O.  said on a conference call Thursday when announcing the increase in the Prime membership fee. The cost pressures from shipping are getting uncomfortable for Amazon. Worldwide shipping costs totaled $6.1 billion in the first quarter of this year  equivalent to 22.5 percent of Amazon’s sales from its online stores during the period. That’s up from 2017  when quarterly shipping costs averaged 19.9 percent of online sales. By bringing shipping costs back down to 20 percent of online sales  Amazon could  in theory  save over $2.5 billion a year (2.5 percent of annualized first-quarter sales comes to roughly $2.8 billion.) To save money  Amazon could offer free shipping on fewer goods  but that could undermine the company’s efforts to bolster sales. And Amazon doesn’t need to do that if it can increase its Prime fees  to help recoup the higher shipping costs. But the fee increase may not be enough. Charging 100 million Prime members an extra $20 per year  in theory  raises “only“ $2 billion. - Peter Eavis None More on her challenge  from the NYT: Few leaders seem less personally in sync with Mr. Trump than Ms. Merkel. Estranged by widely diverging temperaments and leadership styles  the two leaders have also clashed on substance — from climate change and military spending to Germany’s chronic  yawning trade surplus with the United States  a particular bugbear of the president. Or as a former State Department official told the NYT  “Merkel is going to Washington and it looks like the U.S. just doesn’t care.” But a foreign relations expert said  “Never underestimate Merkel.” None None Advertisement A combination of the two companies would complete one of the telecommunications industry’s most long-awaited transactions and would create the third-largest wireless carrier in the United States  with more than 127 million customers. Sprint and T-Mobile have tried to negotiate a merger twice before. Analysts have argued  and Sprint and T-Mobile themselves have acknowledged  that the companies need greater scale and more resources to better compete against the industry’s leaders  Verizon and AT&T. Should the deal be completed  only three companies would dominate the market in the United States for cellphone service. It is unclear whether the transaction would get regulatory approval. A previous round of merger talks ended in 2014  having drawn strong opposition from the Obama administration. — Michael de la Merced None What Mr. Ubben had to say: “The management and board of FOX has done a superb job of steering the company through a time of transition for the entertainment industry.” What Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch had to say: “Jeff has been an important partner during a transformational period. Our board and  ultimately  our shareholders  have benefited enormously from his many contributions.” — Michael de la Merced None None None Advertisement None • Nonresidential fixed investment — what businesses spend on equipment  software  buildings and intellectual property — increased at a solid 6.1 percent. • Business spending on equipment climbed 4.7 percent  down from 11.6 percent in the fourth quarter. None Bigger picture Economists on Wall Street and in Washington have repeatedly warned that the economy’s upward streak is unlikely to extend beyond the next year or two. Over the longer term  the Fed expects real annual growth in the United States to fall to 1.8 percent. The Congressional Budget Office’s 10-year outlook comes to the same disappointing conclusion. The nation’s debt has topped $21 trillion and is growing  a level many view as unsustainable. And if the Federal Reserve follows through on its plan to raise interest rates  the cost of paying off that debt will grow larger. None • Hubris: Unlike rivals  Deutsche Bank didn’t raise capital after the financial crisis  ultimately leaving it significantly weaker. By the end of last year  its tangible equity capital ratio was still below JPMorgan Chase in 2011. (Perhaps Germany’s banking regulator should have applied more pressure  as Switzerland’s did.) • Fear: Did Deutsche Bank’s leaders worry about scaling back the investment bank because of its huge importance for revenue?

https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/09/business/09reuters-china-finance.html,"Chinese Firms Slow to Reduce Share-Backed Loans Despite Regulator Crackdown Advertisement Supported by None SHANGHAI/HONG KONG — Chinese companies are only gradually reducing the amount of shares pledged for loans despite curbs by regulators as part of efforts to reduce the risk the deals pose to market stability. More than 100 companies still have more than 50 percent of their shares pledged  according to Reuters analysis of official data  despite a cap fixed at that level which was introduced two months ago. The practice of borrowing against big blocks of shares - also known as margin lending - jumped sharply last year in China as company founders and large shareholders used rising markets to fund loans for personal use or company business. The loans are advanced at a discount of as much as 50 percent to the market price of the collateral.  Large pledges can risk destabilising markets if borrowers cannot meet margin calls following price moves  leaving lenders free to dump the collateral - and to trigger a change of company ownership if the shareholding is large enough. China's securities regulator introduced new rules in March that prevent any transaction from raising the proportion of pledged shares to above 50 percent of total shares. But in spite of new restrictions  including on brokers' exposure as well as the 50-percent cap  a total of 131 companies with a combined market capitalisation of 2.04 trillion yuan (236.27 billion pounds) still had more than 50 percent of their shares pledged as of the end of April. Since the beginning of 2017  the number of listed Chinese firms with more than half their shares pledged has risen by 48 percent  according to analysis of China Depository Securities and Clearing data. ""A large number of listed firms changing ownership could cause instability in daily operations  which in turn could have a negative impact on share prices "" said Meng Shen  director of Chanson & Co  a boutique investment bank. Controlling shareholders of at least 24 listed firms had pledged at least 90 percent of their shares as of early May  according to Reuters analysis of market data  heightening the risk of a change of control if markets fall.  Share-backed lending is common around the world  particularly in emerging markets where many companies are controlled by founding families. Hong Kong regulators are also concerned about the scale of the borrowing. Julia Leung  deputy chief executive of the Securities and Futures Commission  said last week that there was HK$206 billion ($26.24 billion) worth of margin loans outstanding at the end of 2017  a nine-fold increase since 2006.  ""It is not only the amount  but also the quality of the collateral that is concerning us "" she said.  Leung added that the watchdog was particularly concerned about borrowers pledging shares from smaller  thinly-traded companies. That can leave markets vulnerable to sharp unexplained price moves and also gives lenders less security in the event of company difficulties. In the mainland as in Hong Kong  the use of pledged shares has been most pronounced among smaller firms  who often have less access to bank credit. A total of 54 companies listed on Shenzhen's tech-focused ChiNext board or its small and medium-sized enterprise board had more than 50 percent of their shares pledged - up 38 percent from 2016  when the practice waned following China's market crash in 2015. Banks this year began tightening lending standards ahead of the rule changes  following a stock market tumble in early February that saw shares suffer their worst one-day fall in almost two years. China Merchants Bank  the country's fifth-largest listed bank by market value  was one lender that did so  said two people with direct knowledge. ""The discount of 30 to 50 percent remains the same  but it's tougher for an enterprise to qualify for this sort of loan "" said one of the people  adding that some smaller companies were now unable to get them.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/28/business/dealbook/trade-us-korea-china.html,More Than Just a Sell-Off in Tech?: DealBook Briefing Advertisement With Andrew Ross Sorkin None Good Wednesday. Here’s what we’re watching. • Are we witnessing the end of the tech mania? • Amazon has shed more than $50 billion in market value. •Are investors waking up to Tesla’s real problem? • Mark Zuckerberg agreed to testify before Congress. • SoftBank and Saudi Arabia are planning the world’s largest solar energy project. None Investors  always willing to believe in technology companies  spent the last three years piling into the shares of companies like Facebook  Amazon and Netflix with special abandon. Now the intellectual underpinnings of the tech rally are being seriously tested. Advertisement Stocks in the best-known tech companies have plunged in recent days. The NYSE FANG+ index  which tracks the share price of 10 companies  including Facebook  Apple and Amazon  has fallen nearly 14 percent from its recent high. Given that the index has soared 50 percent in just the past 12 months  the recent decline could just be the sort of sell-off that punctuates any long-term rally. Advertisement Still  several large tech companies suddenly face challenges that could undermine their ability to transform whole industries. And as we’ve seen after previous fervors  investors can take a long time to regain their faith. Facebook is down 20 percent from its recent high. Most of the slide came after news reports showing how the company’s data was misused. Investors have to grapple with the possibility that Facebook won’t be sharing as much data as it does  undermining its ability to generate ever-increasing amounts of advertising revenue. Nvidia  a computer chip maker intent on being a leader in automated driving technology  is off 12 percent from its recent high. The company said on Tuesday that it would halt tests of its autonomous driving technology on public roads after an Uber self-driving car hit and killed a pedestrian in Arizona. Tesla is not a tech stock  but it is included in the FANG+ index  and its supporters believe deeply in its power to revolutionize the auto industry. Growing fears about Tesla’s ability to finance its expansion have helped drag its stock down 33 percent from its recent high. Ominously  the price of Tesla’s bonds is also falling  signaling that the company is losing the confidence of creditors. Of course  on their march higher  tech stocks overcame obstacles  like management problems at Uber and the poor performance of Snap’s initial public offering. But the latest problems have raised deeper  broader doubts  and that may keep the uncertainty around longer. Investors have viewed automated driving technology as a huge potential source of growth for some companies. But after the Uber incident in Arizona  those companies may take a more realistic look at what they have to spend to create a technology that is efficient and safe  and conclude that they have to pull out of the race or pare back. Users of social media and regulators may prevent social media companies from sharing so much of their data with advertisers  and that could restrain revenue growth. And if the passion for two or three big tech companies wanes  the cooling may spread. — Peter Eavis The reason? Advertisement Reports that President Trump wants to rein in the e-commerce giant. None “Trump has talked about changing Amazon’s tax treatment because he’s worried about mom-and-pop retailers being put out of business.” Mr. Swan added: “Trump’s wealthy friends tell him Amazon is destroying their businesses. His real estate buddies tell him — and he agrees — that Amazon is killing shopping malls and brick-and-mortar retailers.” None How concerned should investors be? GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives writes: “While it’s now a hand holding time for Amazon given this new regulatory potential threat  we believe the reality of these worries altering the company’s business model and future tax structure are low and we would be buyers of the name on weakness.” None On a day when the stocks on Wall Street are flat  Macy’s was up 3.5 percent  J.C. Penney has gained 5.5 percent  Walmart rose 1.7 percent  Target increased 1.8 percent  and Kohl’s was up 2.4 percent. The electric carmaker’s shares are down 7 percent Wednesday  after plunging 8 percent on Tuesday. None But the continued decline in Tesla’s stock — its shares are down more than 20 percent since mid-March — speaks to the bigger concern surrounding Tesla: How it funds itself. None None Liam Denning of Bloomberg Gadfly writes: “Challenges on the factory floor and the balance sheet are converging. Drawing inexorably closer to a refinancing wall  Tesla needs a real shot of confidence  and capital  to keep its money machine turning over this year. “Given Tuesday’s bond blowout  that almost certainly means tapping the equity market again. Nothing like being a motivated seller to put a floor under a stock price  right?” The fallout from Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal has spread to Twitter.

https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/01/business/01reuters-apple-results-buybacks.html,"Apple Plows U.S. Tax Cuts Into Record Share Buybacks Advertisement Supported by None SAN FRANCISCO — Apple Inc lavished cash on its shareholders like no company in history in the first three months of the year and it intends to keep doing so  making the iPhone maker's investors the clearest winners yet from last year's sweeping U.S. corporate tax cuts. With a mountain of overseas cash suddenly freed up by the tax overhaul  Apple bought back $23.5 billion of its own stock in the March quarter  a record amount for any U.S. company  according to S&P Dow Jones Indices  and it added $100 billion to its target for future repurchases.  It also doled out another $3.2 billion in dividends and will boost them by 16 percent going forward. The amount Apple spent buying its shares in those three months exceeded the stock market value of most companies in the S&P 500 index  including household names like Kroger Co  Best Buy Co Inc and Hershey Co.  The decision to turn over record amounts of cash to shareholders was a direct results of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed by Republican lawmakers in December.  It also coincided with a bout of volatility on Wall Street in recent months that has many investors worried that a nine-year bull market may be ending. Apple's beefed up plans to return cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks will provide additional support for its stock price. The biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in over 30 years  the new law slashes the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent  and charges multinationals a one-time tax on profits held overseas. As a result  analysts had expected Apple to repatriate most of its $252 billion in cash abroad. In its quarterly report on Tuesday  Apple said it would earmark $100 billion for a new share repurchase program  succeeding a $210 billion buyback program that started in 2012 and will wrap up this quarter - roughly nine months ahead of schedule. Given the size of the expanded program  Apple has not placed a termination date on it. ""We are not giving an end date to the program this time because the amount is very  very large "" Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told analysts on a conference call. ""But we also want to do it efficiently. We want to make sure that we buy back the stock at the right time."" Roughly $400 billion worth of Apple stock changed hands in that March quarter  and the company's gross purchases would account for between 5 percent and 6 percent of that. Apple's program dwarfs others even as stock repurchase efforts kick into high gear. By comparison  U.S. companies in April announced a combined total of $50.4 billion in new buyback plans  up from $38.1 billion worth of planned buybacks announced in April 2017  according to TrimTabs Investment Research. The first quarter of 2018 was the biggest quarter on record for buyback announcements  with $242.1 billion worth of buybacks announced by U.S. companies  according to TrimTabs. Apple said its dividend increase would be reflected in a cash dividend of 73 cents per share payable on May 17. Its current payout is 63 cents a share.  Other companies announcing plans to return cash to shareholders include Facebook Inc  which announced a $9 billion buyback program when it reported earnings last week  and AbbVie Inc  which plans a tender offer starting as early as May 1 to buy up to $7.5 billion of its stock. Broadcom Inc unveiled a $12 billion buyback program on April 13.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/22/opinion/steel-tariffs-and-wage-painfully-wonkish.html,Steel Tariffs and Wages (Painfully Wonkish) Advertisement Supported by None Opinion Columnist There’s a pretty good case that Trump’s declaration that “Trade wars are good  and easy to win” will eventually go down in history as the economic equivalent of “We will be greeted as liberators.” One reason is the general economic proposition that trade wars make the world as a whole poorer  and while it’s possible that you can grab a bigger share of a smaller pie  you need a lot of that to end up a winner. Beyond that  however  Trump is even doing trade war wrong  by imposing tariffs on steel and other intermediate goods. It’s pretty obvious why this is a bad idea: it raises costs and hurts downstream industries. But I’m enough of an old international economics nerd that I wanted a specific model of how that happens. So what follows is a finger exercise (short fingers  I guess) – an itsy-bitsy teeny-weeny model of how protectionism on intermediate goods can reduce wages. The purpose is basically to scratch my own intellectual itch  most readers should probably stop here  because this is even more wonkish than my usual wonkishness. None What is central  I think  is that doing this Trump-style turns even the sort-of-kind-of good arguments for tariffs on their head. None The trouble is that if other countries retaliate  much or all of the improvement in the terms of trade goes away  and what you’re left with is distorted incentives and lower productivity. This  according to one argument  is why we have international trade agreements. Each country has a unilateral incentive to impose tariffs  but if everyone does it – if we have a trade war – the world becomes poorer. So we need rules that keep that prospect in check. None Anyway  the whole market power argument generally starts with models in which countries trade in final goods  and tariffs are imposed on those goods. Yet much of world trade is now in intermediate goods  which are used as inputs in the production of other goods – and the Trump tariffs are focused on intermediates  especially steel. And even aside from the risk of retaliation  that’s a policy that will work out not necessarily to America’s advantage. Which brings me to my finger exercise. Imagine a world of two countries  Home and Foreign. (That’s an old-fashioned trade theory convention.) In both countries  labor is the only factor of production (not gonna get into income distribution today). There are two goods  cars and steel. Cars are a final good  sold to consumers  steel is an input into car production. I’m going to assume that both countries end up producing cars. To keep down on notation  I’m going to do some sneaky things with choice of units (another old trade theory tradition.) We assume that in each country building a car requires one unit of labor (which amounts to measuring labor in units of how much it takes to build a car.)

Advertisement Supported by Strategies None Earnings season is underway on Wall Street and  thanks to a heady combination of core business strength and tax windfalls  the results have been exceptional. In fact  based on the numbers so far  profits among the biggest American corporations are growing so fast that you may expect the stock market to be soaring like a rocket. That’s not the direction the market has been heading  of course. Since February  most stocks have been sluggish — or downright negative — and the spectacular earnings reports have received less fanfare than they probably deserve. None Add the negative impact of rising interest rates and heightened expectations for inflation — both of which tend to hurt share prices — and it’s easy to see why the stock market weakened as much as it did. None None Tax windfalls are certainly inflating the numbers  but the core earnings of American corporations look solid  nonetheless. Consider the picture for the first three months of 2018  the period for current earnings reports. By one measure  the quarter is actually turning out to have been the best for corporate America in decades. The tax cuts that went into effect this year have transformed excellent earnings into exceptional ones. David Aurelio  a senior research analyst for Thomson Reuters  says nearly 80 percent of the companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index that have reported so far have outstripped the expectations of Wall Street — 16 percentage points higher than the average number of companies that beat expectations. “That performance is the best since our records started in 1994 ” he said. Earnings per share have grown 26 percent since the same quarter a year earlier  according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data. Net operating income — essentially  profit after taxes — has risen nearly 25 percent in the same period. Almost half of that gain  11.6 percentage points  comes from the big cut in corporate taxes that took effect this year. The tax windfall alone accounts for a larger earnings increase than the stock market typically receives from conventional sources  the data shows. Expectations of a tax cut may help explain the run-up in stocks in 2017 and earlier this year. But writing off the current earnings surge entirely as a pure artifact of tax cuts would be a mistake. Before taxes  earnings grew 13.2 percent for the quarter. That is a breathtaking figure. “Whenever you get double-digit earnings growth coming from core earnings  it is really healthy ” Mr. Aurelio said. “What I find surprising is that  aside from the tax cuts  fundamentals are really looking strong ” he added. None None The tax changes mean that Apple suddenly has “increased financial and operational flexibility from the access to our global cash ” which had been stranded abroad  said Luca Maestri  Apple’s chief financial officer. So Apple announced a $100 billion increase in what had been a $300 billion share buyback program  as well as a 16 percent dividend increase. None Apple’s operating income rose more than 10 percent in the quarter  an impressive figure in its own right  and the end of the Apple profit machine is nowhere in sight. Apple isn’t the only company to have churned out outstanding earnings. Profits have been rising for most big American companies  and Wall Street expects that to continue for at least the next year or two. Edward Yardeni  an independent market strategist  points out that double-digit earnings growth isn’t likely to be sustained by corporate America. Profit growth is likely to decline to the roughly 7 percent annual rate that has been the historic norm  he says. And the norm is that stock market will rise at about that rate over the long run. He expects that to continue. While the market has barely noticed the current avalanche of profits  the combination of stagnant prices and rising earnings means that market valuations have already improved rapidly. If that trend continues  many stocks will again begin to look like bargains. Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,business

None None The documentary filmmaker and photographer Lauren Greenfield’s ambitious new book  “Generation Wealth ” showcases her chronicling of the lifestyles of the rich and famous over the last 20 years. One photo in particular caught my eye  because I happened to be there when it was taken. I’d been interviewing homeless kids in Tucson for a Vanity Fair article in 2003 when Greenfield was sent to take the pictures for it. (The article was never published.) Greenfield’s caption reads: “Jedi has consciously rejected his family’s affluent  mainstream existence in favor of a transient life.” This wasn’t how I remembered the young man  so I checked my transcripts and confirmed that he actually grew up poor and left home  as so many homeless kids do  because of poverty and family issues. I mention this discrepancy not to flag an error  but because I think it’s important to note  when considering a visual collection Greenfield calls “a sociological document ” that photographers are always looking through a certain lens. It’s not that one needs to argue with her thesis (stated in both her lengthy introduction and a foreword by the sociologist Juliet Schor) that income inequality has gotten out of hand  that our obsession with wealth and fame diminishes and dehumanizes us in far-reaching ways. Rather  one ought to ask  whom does Greenfield offer up as examples? And how does she choose to depict them? Many of the subjects featured in this collection are female. The conspicuous consumption on display occurs largely among wealthy women and teenage girls (a young Kim Kardashian makes an appearance)  models and strippers  4- and 5-year-old beauty pageant contestants and prom queens. In her foreword  Schor summarizes this theme as the “objectification of women.” But looking at the images one wonders if they themselves do not also participate in this objectification. These are not kind photographs  some seem to mock their subjects  portraying them as frivolous and shallow  hard and crass. The tone is in keeping with how the wider media has often dealt with our collective anxiety over the fascination with money and fame: by projecting it  with great contempt  onto the bodies and personalities of women and girls  as in reality shows like “Toddlers and Tiaras” and the “Real Housewives” series. Greenfield’s photograph of the 6-year-old “Toddlers and Tiaras” star Eden Wood shows her sticking out her tongue provocatively for the camera  recalling notoriously sexualized images of JonBenet Ramsey. The close-up shot of Jackie Siegel’s breast-augmented cleavage  festooned with a bejeweled necklace  cuts off her head  an alteration that’s arguably as dehumanizing as the very sociological phenomena Greenfield decries. Siegel is the presumptive would-be sovereign on “The Queen of Versailles ” Greenfield’s compelling documentary about the rise and fall of the timeshare mogul David Siegel  who unsuccessfully sued Greenfield for defamation in 2012. Men like Siegel — corporate kingpins who bear much of the blame for the ravages of greed — don’t share as much time in this collection as do women. Unlike their female counterparts  Greenfield’s male subjects aren’t scrounging on the floor for dollar bills or perched on all fours before and after plastic surgery. Mostly  they are seated or standing in their plush offices and homes  looking powerful  if sinister. The photographs in “Generation Wealth” are predominantly of white people. When people of color appear  they are usually not rich. They are gang members in Compton  Calif.  students from Crenshaw High School who’ve been selected by a magazine to be luxuriously outfitted with lent dresses and jewels for prom. Most of the more affluent African-Americans in the collection are hip-hop stars  some displaying their bling (Tupac and Jay-Z are featured). Greenfield claims in her introduction to have found  over the course of this two-decade project  that she was “unearthing a pattern” regarding “the influence of affluence.” But clearly there was another pattern to be found in the types of assignments she was being given. Many of the images in this book accompanied reports that appeared in major publications  from Time to Newsweek to National Geographic. The media’s influence on our obsession with wealth and fame is something she mentions but never probes  but it is there  falling onto the shoulders of the women and girls in her photos who power-shop and proudly display their luxury loot  and perhaps even dream of becoming the next Kim Kardashian.

Monthly figures from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers show that passenger cars sales in April rose 11 percent over a year earlier to 1.9 million vehicles  outpacing a 3.5 percent growth rate in March. Sales of ""new-energy vehicles"" such as electric cars and gasoline-electric hybrids more than doubled to 82 000. China's communist leaders view electric vehicles as key to transforming China into a technological superpower. Global automakers including General Motors  Nissan and Volkswagen unveiled dozens of electric and hybrid vehicles at the Beijing auto show last month. Recent moves by Beijing to loosen up restrictions on foreign ownership in the auto industry gave priority to the electric vehicle industry. Under the new rules  requirements for foreign car brands to team up with local state-owned partners will be scrapped by 2022  while limits on foreign ownership of electric vehicle producers will be eliminated this year. The relaxed regulations came amid rising trade tensions between the U.S. and China that might dent U.S. auto imports — Ford vehicles are facing longer waits as Chinese customs agents tighten up inspections. The company said its China sales fell 26 percent in April to 69 503 vehicles. China's total vehicle sales including trucks and buses rose 11.5 percent to 2.3 million. The latest numbers are an improvement on uneven sales earlier this year and a lackluster performance last year as sales growth cooled following a surge in 2016 that was driven by tax cuts. Automakers forecast total market growth for China this year of 3 to 4 percent  a fraction of earlier double-digit rates. Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ",business
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/17/business/justices-divided-on-sales-taxes-for-online-purchases.html,Supreme Court Divided on Sales Taxes for Online Purchases Advertisement Supported by None WASHINGTON — A closely divided Supreme Court struggled on Tuesday to decide whether internet retailers should have to collect sales taxes in states where they have no physical presence. Brick-and-mortar businesses have long complained that they are disadvantaged by having to charge sales taxes while many of their online competitors do not. States have said that they are missing out on tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue under a 1992 Supreme Court ruling that helped spur the rise of internet shopping. None Several justices expressed concerns about imposing crushing burdens on small businesses that sell goods on the internet and about making them liable for back taxes. Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the case before the court  South Dakota v. Wayfair  No. 17-494  raised “a host of questions” and “a whole new set of difficulties.” Sounding almost plaintive  she added that Congress  rather than the Supreme Court  was the right forum in which to settle the matter. “Is there anything we can do to give Congress a signal that it should act more affirmatively in this area?” Justice Sotomayor asked. But Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said that “it would be very strange for us to tell Congress it ought to do something in any particular area.” Both he and Justice Elena Kagan said the fact that Congress has so far chosen not to act was itself a telling indication that it was satisfied with the current system. The chief justice added that the marketplace may already be addressing the problem. “The bigger e-commerce companies find themselves with a physical presence in all 50 states ” he said  “so they’re already covered.” None Justice Gorsuch seemed prepared on Tuesday to reconsider the Quill decision. “Why should this court favor a particular business model?” he asked. None “It is unwise to delay any longer a reconsideration of the court’s holding in Quill ” he wrote. “A case questionable even when decided  Quill now harms states to a degree far greater than could have been anticipated earlier.” South Dakota responded to Justice Kennedy’s invitation by enacting a law that required all merchants to collect a 4.5 percent sales tax if they had more than $100 000 in annual sales or more than 200 individual transactions in the state. State officials sued three large online retailers — Wayfair  Overstock.com and Newegg — for violating the law. “The South Dakota law is obviously a test case ” Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said on Tuesday. “It was devised to present the most reasonable incarnation of this scheme.” “But do you have any doubt ” Justice Alito asked a lawyer for the federal government  “that states that are tottering on the edge of insolvency and municipalities  which may be in even worse position  have a strong incentive to grab everything they possibly can?” The lawyer  Malcolm L. Stewart  who argued in support of South Dakota  did not disagree. “Many states would adopt regimes that are less hospitable to retailers” if the court allowed them to require the collection of taxes  he said  “unless they were stopped from doing that by Congress.” Justice Alito suggested that a decision from the Supreme Court could short-circuit a more nuanced legislative consideration of the issue. “As things stand now ” he said  “it seems that both the states and internet retailers have an incentive to ask for a congressional solution to this problem.” Lower courts ruled for the online retailers in the South Dakota case  citing the Quill decision. None At Tuesday’s argument  Marty J. Jackley  South Dakota’s attorney general  argued that the Quill decision did not make sense in the digital era. He said that the major practical problem it had identified — that it would be burdensome for out-of-state retailers to calculate and collect taxes for thousands of state and local jurisdictions — had been solved by modern software. But that assertion was hotly disputed by George S. Isaacson  a lawyer for the three internet retailers  who said a ruling against his clients would impose burdens on small online merchants. A national solution  he said  should come from Congress rather than the Supreme Court. Some justices complained that they lacked fundamental information about how hard it is to collect the taxes and how much money is at stake. The two sides  Justice Stephen G. Breyer said  were of little help. Estimates of how much it would cost internet businesses to comply with the tax laws of what were said to be 12 000 state and local jurisdictions varied from $12 to $250 000. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said there could be a market solution  too. “If we did overrule Quill ” she said  “entrepreneurs would produce software that would meet the market need.” None None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,business

Carlsberg  the world's third-largest brewer behind Anheuser Busch InBev and Heineken  continued to lose market share in Russia  where it owns the Baltika brand and which accounts for around a fifth of sales.

""Our volumes grew in all markets except for Russia "" Chief Executive Cees t'Hart said on a conference call.

Retail sales  an often revised indicator  rose by just 0.1 percent in March for a 0.8 percent annual increase  Eurostat said. That compared with expansion of 0.3 percent in the month and 1.8 percent year-on-year in February. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected an increase of 0.5 percent month-on-month and an annual increase of 1.9 percent. While their volatile nature makes retail sales an unreliable indicator  the drop is in line with a slight cooling of the euro zone economy  as underlined by slowing economic growth in the first quarter of 2018. The slowdown in retail sales was mainly due to a decline in spending on non-food items  especially clothing and pharmaceutical goods. Spending on food and drink increased slightly  while mail order and online shopping showed a growth of 3.3 percent from February. On a country-by-country basis  retail sales fell most in Ireland and Germany  while Latvia  Portugal and Austria showed a sharp increases during March.

https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/02/business/ap-eu-europe-economy.html,"Late Winter Blast Sees Eurozone Growth Slow in Momentum Advertisement Supported by None LONDON — After posting its highest growth in a decade during 2017  the 19-country eurozone lost some momentum at the start of the new year  largely because of temporary factors such as the ""Beast from the East"" cold weather phenomenon that gripped much of Europe in late winter. In its first estimate  Eurostat  the European Union's statistics agency  said Wednesday that growth across the single currency bloc slowed in the first three months of the year to a quarterly rate of 0.4 percent from a hefty 0.7 percent tick the previous quarter. That is the lowest growth figure since the third quarter of 2016  when it was also 0.4 percent. Eurostat provided no explanations for the slowdown  but it was in line with economists' expectations following a run of soft activity data attributed partly to temporary factors such as the bad weather gripping Europe in March  the acute volatility in stock markets  strikes and even a particularly nasty outbreak of flu in Germany. However  there are some longer-term concerns such as the euro's relative strength that may keep a lid on growth in the months to come — a higher euro can make the region's exports more expensive in international markets. Another potential headache could come in the shape of a trade war with the U.S. if President Donald Trump goes ahead with his plan to impose a series of tariffs. ""Mounting uncertainty could translate to confidence falling further and much-needed investment being held back "" said Moritz Degler  an economist at Oxford Economics. ""As such  even if a full-blown trade war does not materialize  the mere threat of it has the potential to further dent sentiment and the eurozone's growth path this year."" As a result of the quarterly slowdown  growth on an annual basis eased  too  though it was a still-healthy 2.5 percent against 2.8 percent in the previous quarter. That also compares favorably with the United States where the annual rate of growth stood at 2.3 percent during the same period. Separately  Eurostat said unemployment across the region held steady at a near 10-year low of 8.5 percent in March. Overall there were 13.82 million people out of work in the eurozone  down by 83 000 on the month before. The decline in unemployment has accelerated over the past year as the region's recovery has gained momentum across sectors and across countries — in 2017  the eurozone was one of the standouts of the global economy  growing by 2.5 percent  its highest level since 2007. The region has benefited from waning fears over debt-ridden Greece and the defeat of a run of populist — and anti-euro — politicians in elections in France and the Netherlands. The improving employment backdrop should help the region deal with changes related to the impact of fluctuations in the value of the euro  which currently stands at around $1.20. ""With more people in work and rising wages  domestic demand should be able to absorb some of the fluctuations in international markets for euro area products "" said Kay Daniel Neufeld  managing economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research. Though the European Central Bank has been encouraged by the economy's momentum  it's still pursuing crisis-era policies in order to get the annual rate of inflation back to its goal of just below 2 percent. Financial markets think the bank will start reining in those policies when inflation is showing clear signs of settling around that level. Figures Thursday are set to show inflation rising modestly to 1.4 percent from 1.3 percent in March. Anything substantially higher could prompt some to mull the possibility the ECB will bring forward the end of its bond-buying program and start reversing its interest rate cuts  which have seen its main rate slashed to zero.

The Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday also showed wages barely rose last month  which may ease concerns that inflation pressures are rapidly building up  likely keeping the Federal Reserve on a gradual path of monetary policy tightening.  ""Fed officials can rest easy that there is not any wage-based inflation on the horizon "" said Chris Rupkey  chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""There is no need to speed up the path of interest rates because inflation isn't heating up in a worrisome manner."" Nonfarm payrolls increased by 164 000 jobs last month  the Labor Department reported. Data for March was revised to show the economy adding 135 000 jobs instead of the previously reported 103 000. That was the fewest amount of jobs created in six months and followed an outsized gain of 324 000 in February. While cold weather in March and April probably held back job growth  hiring is moderating as the labor market hits full employment. Employers  especially in the construction and manufacturing sectors  are increasingly reporting difficulties finding qualified workers. The drop of two-tenths of a percentage point in the unemployment rate from 4.1 percent in March pushed it to a level last seen in December 2000 and within striking distance of the Fed's forecast of 3.8 percent by the end of this year.

The labor force participation rate  or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one  fell to 62.8 percent last month from 62.9 percent in March.

https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/04/business/04reuters-usa-economy.html,"U.S. Job Growth Picks Up  Unemployment Rate Falls to 3.9 Percent Advertisement Supported by None WASHINGTON — U.S. job growth increased less than expected in April and the unemployment rate dropped to near a 17-1/2-year low of 3.9 percent as some out-of-work Americans left the labour force.  The Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday also showed wages barely rose last month  which may ease concerns that inflation pressures are rapidly building up  likely keeping the Federal Reserve on a gradual path of monetary policy tightening.  ""Fed officials can rest easy that there is not any wage-based inflation on the horizon "" said Chris Rupkey  chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""There is no need to speed up the path of interest rates because inflation isn't heating up in a worrisome manner."" Nonfarm payrolls increased by 164 000 jobs last month  the Labor Department reported. Data for March was revised to show the economy adding 135 000 jobs instead of the previously reported 103 000. That was the fewest amount of jobs created in six months and followed an outsized gain of 324 000 in February. While cold weather in March and April probably held back job growth  hiring is moderating as the labour market hits full employment. Employers  especially in the construction and manufacturing sectors  are increasingly reporting difficulties finding qualified workers. The drop of two-tenths of a percentage point in the unemployment rate from 4.1 percent in March pushed it to a level last seen in December 2000 and within striking distance of the Fed's forecast of 3.8 percent by the end of this year. It was the first time in six months that the jobless rate dropped. But 236 000 people left the labour force in April  adding to the 158 000 who quit in March.

https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/09/business/09reuters-mitsubishimotors-results.html,"Mitsubishi Motors Sees Higher Annual Profit on Asia Sales Advertisement Supported by None TOKYO — Mitsubishi Motors Corp said on Wednesday it expects operating profit to rise 12 percent in the current financial year  driven by higher vehicle sales in Asia. Mitsubishi Motors has been counting on growth in the region to help it return to profit levels seen before a mileage scandal in 2016. The company's admission that it had overstated mileage levels on domestic models had eroded sales at home and resulted in massive compensation costs for the automaker. Japan's seventh-largest automaker said it expects operating profit to rise to 110.0 billion yen ($1.0 billion) in the year to March 2019  mostly in line with the median forecast for 111.5 billion yen in a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S poll. Its profit had slumped to 5.1 billion yen in the year to March 2017 due to the mileage scandal  before rebounding 20-fold to 98.2 billion yen in the year that just ended. It expects to sell 1.25 million vehicles in the current financial year  up 14 percent from the previous year  led by sales in Southeast Asia  its biggest regional market where sales of its recently-launched Xpander minivan have been booming. It also forecast strong growth in China  where its local joint venture is growing production capacity. ""The sales recovery in Japan will also support the growth "" it said in a statement. Under a three-year strategy unveiled in October  the company plans to boost annual global sales by 30 percent  focusing on growth in Southeast Asia  China and the United States. As part of an alliance that includes Nissan Motor Co and Renault SA  Mitsubishi is also targeting cost-savings of more than 100 billion yen over the next three years through development and procurement efficiencies.
