The attack came shortly before Burundians vote May 17 in a controversial referendum that could extend the president's term. It was not immediately clear if the attack was related  although some activists said they believe it was. Speaking at the scene  Security Minister Alain Guillaume Bunyoni told reporters that 24 people were killed in their homes Friday night and two others died of their wounds at a local hospital. He gave no further details about the attack in Ruhagarika community in the northwestern province of Cibitoke. One survivor told The Associated Press the attackers came around 10 p.m. and ""attacked households and set fire on houses."" Some victims were hacked with machetes and others were shot or burned alive  she said. Her husband and two children were killed  she said. She spoke on condition of anonymity  citing safety concerns. ""These killers attacked my family and I am very angry "" said another survivor  Pascal Hakizimana. ""My family is dead and to make matters worse  the army did nothing to save them even when they were not far from here."" A police officer  who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to a reporter  said four of the families targeted were headed by people he called ""police agents."" ""(The attackers) said when leaving  'Where are those you trust to rescue you?"" he said. Activists expressed concern. ""This is extra-judiciary killings. What one can ask is this: Do we have to see innocent people killed whenever elections are near in Burundi?"" said Gerard Hakizimana  leader of a pro-democracy civic group known as Folucon F. President Pierre Nkuruniza  on Twitter  urged unity in the East African nation and said those who carried out the attack would be pursued and punished. Burundi has seen deadly political violence since early 2015 when Nkurunziza successfully pursued a disputed third term. He later survived a coup attempt led by senior army and police officers  including some who fled and announced they had launched a rebel group against the government. An estimated 1 200 people  including ruling party supporters  have died in sporadic violence since April 2015  according to the United Nations  with most of the killings blamed on the authorities and their allies. Now Burundians are being asked to vote on a proposal to extend the president's term from five years to seven  which would allow Nkurunziza to rule for another 14 years when his current term expires in 2020. Campaigns ahead of the referendum have been marred by hate speech  with one ruling party official sent to prison after he called for those who oppose the referendum to be drowned. The United States earlier this month denounced ""violence  intimidation  and harassment"" against those thought to oppose the referendum and expressed concern about the ""non-transparent process"" of changing the constitution. Human Rights Watch has noted ""widespread impunity"" for authorities and their allies  including the ruling party's youth wing  as they try to swing the vote in the president's favor. Many in Burundi  a poor country that still relies heavily on foreign aid  worry that a new round of bloodshed will follow the referendum no matter its results. Already more than 400 000 people have fled the country since April 2015  according to the U.N. Nkurunziza  a former rebel leader  rose to power in 2005 following the end of Burundi's civil war that killed about 300 000 people. He was re-elected unopposed in 2010 after the opposition boycotted. He said he was eligible for a third term in 2015 because lawmakers  not the general population  chose him for his first term. ___ Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ",terrorism

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/world/europe/spain-eta-disbands-basque.html,Basque Group ETA Disbands  After Terrorist Campaign Spanning Generations Advertisement Supported by None MADRID — ETA  the Basque separatist group  is dissolving itself  it stated in a letter published on Wednesday  closing a history that included one of the longest terrorism campaigns in modern Europe  which killed over 800 people in Spain. Militants of ETA had been expected to make a formal announcement some time this week  after almost six decades of fruitless and violent resistance to the central government in Madrid. None But the letter  first obtained by a Basque journalist at the online publication Eldiario.es  insisted that the Basque conflict with Spain — and  to a lesser degree  with France — “did not begin with ETA and does not end with the end of ETA’s journey.” The news reflected what has been evident for years  that ETA is a spent force  its ranks decimated by arrests  its popularity minimal in the Basque region along Spain’s north coast. In their long struggle  the government has won. Founded in 1959  ETA — whose full Basque name  Euskadi Ta Askatasuna  means Basque Homeland and Freedom — began as a left-wing  student-led independence movement during the dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco. It turned to violence in opposing the Franco government  which suppressed opponents and banned minority cultures and languages  including that spoken by the Basques. The group’s methods at first drew support from a wide range of Franco’s opponents. But it continued to rely on terrorism even after Franco had died  Spain had returned to democracy  and the central government had granted significant autonomy to the Basque region and others. ETA’s use of violence backfired  ensuring now that “the Basque secessionist project will not make any substantial progress until the legacy of deaths and economic losses becomes a distant memory ” said Diego Muro  a Spanish lecturer in international relations at the Handa Center for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence at the University of St Andrews  in Scotland. He said the group’s dissolution “brings to an end the ethnonationalist wave of terrorism that started with the anti-colonialist violence of the second half of the 20th century.” In its letter  ETA wrote that a “lack of will to solve the conflict” had prolonged it  and “multiplied the suffering ” and acknowledged that the group was at least partly to blame. “ETA recognizes the suffering caused as a result of their struggle ” it added. In June 1968  two ETA militants killed a policeman who had stopped them to check their papers and inspect their car — the first death attributed to the group. Two months later  it carried out its first planned assassination  ambushing a police inspector  Melitón Manzanas — who was suspected of torturing communists who resisted Franco — outside his home in Irún  on the French border. In 1973  ETA struck at the top of Franco’s government  killing the prime minister  Adm. Luis Carrero Blanco  with a bomb so powerful that the explosion sent his armored limousine flying over a building. The assassination left Franco  who had only two years to live  without an obvious successor. As Spain transitioned to democracy after Franco’s death  a law enacted in 1977 granted amnesty for crimes committed during the civil war of the 1930s and Franco’s subsequent dictatorship. Spain also began a process of political decentralization that gave regions their own parliaments and significant powers over areas like education and health. The Basque region and a neighbor  Navarre  also received the important right to collect taxes. But ETA rejected such political concessions and instead stepped up its terror campaign demanding an independent state it called Euskal Herria. The group envisioned a nation that would stretch far beyond the modern borders of Spain’s Basque region  to include Navarre and the Basque region of southwest France. In 1980  its bloodiest year  ETA killed almost 100 people  in attacks that increasingly claimed civilian victims. In 1987  in its worst single attack  an ETA bomb killed 21 people at a Barcelona supermarket. None Starting in the late 1980s  ETA announced several cease-fires and occasionally held talks with the Spanish government  first under the conservative prime minister José María Aznar  and then under the Socialist administration led by José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero. But the negotiations and cease-fires repeatedly broke down  while the Spanish government continued to ban politicians seen as being linked to ETA from running in elections. Then  after the arrests of many ETA leaders and operatives  the violence stopped. ETA last killed someone on Spanish soil in 2009  and its last victim anywhere was a French policeman  shot in 2010 during a botched car theft near Paris. None None Since the 2011 cease-fire  the conservative government has rejected international mediation efforts  determined not to allow ETA a brokered deal like the one that ended hostilities in Northern Ireland between the British government and the Irish Republican Army. The Spanish government fears that ETA members and sympathizers could score political points with a negotiated surrender. None ETA “didn’t get anything for stopping to kill and will not get anything for declaring its disappearance ” Mr. Zoido said. Alfonso Alonso  the leader of Spain’s governing Popular Party in the Basque region  also poured cold water on the significance of ETA’s plan to dissolve itself. “Neither its history nor its responsibility can be dissolved ” Mr. Alonso said recently. “We will never forgive ETA.” None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,terrorism
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/12/world/middleeast/military-safe-havens-afghanistan.html,U.S. Braces for Return of Terrorist Safe Havens to Afghanistan Advertisement Supported by None WASHINGTON — For 17 years  three successive presidents have told the American public that above all else  Afghanistan must never again provide “safe haven” to terrorist groups seeking to harm the United States and its interests. But Defense Department and intelligence officials now say exactly that may be on the verge of happening. With the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria in its twilight  American officials are tracking foreign fighters veering to provinces in Afghanistan’s north and east. Meanwhile  Al Qaeda remains a persistent and deadly threat across the country  a senior American general told senators last week. None None None “From the mountains of Tora Bora  we send the glad tidings to the caliph of the Muslims  of the return of the caliphate to this area that was swarming with immigrants and supporters who fought for the caliphate to be established ” a narrator intoned in the video  posted by the Washington-based SITE Intelligence Group  which monitors terrorist organizations. Sweeping footage from the video showed militants training  fighting  eating and praying in remote Afghan areas. In its report  the Institute for the Study of War found that the Islamic State was planning attacks in the United States from safe havens in Afghanistan and Pakistan. It said that residents in Jowzjan Province reported in November that Islamic State extremists from France  Sudan  Chechnya  Uzbekistan and Tajikistan were recruiting fighters and training child suicide bombers. American military officials confirmed that the Islamic State  as well as the Taliban  has now established training camps in Jowzjan Province. In October  the Justice Department unsealed charges against three Islamic State operatives in a plot for coordinated attacks in New York in summer 2016. Two of the men  according to the charges  said they were working with the Islamic State Khorasan in Afghanistan  one said he received authorization from the Afghanistan group for the planned attacks. Most of the concerns about safe havens focus on the Islamic State’s move into Afghanistan. The Islamic State  a successor to Al Qaeda in Iraq  has joined a battle for turf and power among about 20 terrorist groups in Afghanistan  many of them with designs on the West. Together  they make up the highest concentration of extremist groups worldwide among 98 that have been designated as terrorist organizations by the United States or the United Nations  according to Gen. John W. Nicholson  the commander of American and NATO forces in Afghanistan. Many experts say that General Nicholson’s data may be conflated. Yet no one questions that the number of terrorist groups in Afghanistan has increased sharply in recent years — despite the 17-year presence of American troops. “The Afghanistan war is almost old enough to vote  and we have more groups that want to launch attacks against the U.S. operating there than we did when we started ” said Caitlin Forrest  an Afghanistan expert with the Institute for the Study of War. This was not supposed to happen. Weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks  President George W. Bush sent a small group of Special Operations troops into Afghanistan. Ever since  top officials have repeatedly justified the war as necessary to ensure that Afghanistan never again allows safe haven for groups that targeted American interests. “Afghanistan provided safe haven for Al Qaeda ” Mr. Bush said during a 2006 news conference. “That’s where they trained. That’s where they plotted. That’s where they planned the attacks that killed thousands of innocent Americans.” President Barack Obama picked up that mantle when he took office  sending a surge of American troops there in 2009 before declaring the end of the combat mission in Afghanistan a few years later. “As president and commander in chief  I’ve made it clear that I will not allow Afghanistan to be used as safe haven for terrorists to attack our nation again ” Mr. Obama said on July 6  2016. Mr. Trump has struck a similar note. “We are committed to ensuring that Afghanistan never again becomes a safe haven for terrorists who want to commit mass murder of our citizens ” Mr. Trump said in August  announcing a strategy to send an additional 4 000 American troops to the country. But as the Islamic State in Khorasan has surged under Mr. Trump  and the Taliban and Haqqani networks have continued relentless attacks on civilian and military targets in Afghanistan  American officials have increasingly warned that safe havens are back. Administration officials cited a huge concern at United States Central Command  which largely runs the war in Afghanistan  about the return of safe havens. Russia is also worried that an increased Islamic State presence in Afghanistan will further radicalize the Caucasus  as a result  according to Central Command officials  Moscow began supporting the Taliban as a counterweight  sending its fighters weapons and night vision goggles. At a Senate hearing last week  Lt. Gen. Robert P. Ashley  director of the Defense Intelligence Agency  said the Islamic State in Khorasan intended to “expand ISIS’ self-declared caliphate and compete with the Taliban for recognition as the dominant militant group in the region.” He also said that Al Qaeda had “retained the intent and limited capability to threaten coalition and Afghan forces and interests in the region ” a reference to the American-led NATO coalition that has been fighting in Afghanistan. The official line at the Pentagon is that the textbook definition of “safe havens” — where insurgent groups can plan and conduct operations without disruption by significant external factors like arrest and airstrikes — has not quite been re-established in Afghanistan. Military officials said American and Afghan forces were doing just enough to pressure training camps and strongholds that the Islamic State had built in remote and ungoverned areas of the country. One high-profile example of that  Central Command officials said  was the “MOAB” — the massive GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast  nicknamed the “mother of all bombs ” that General Nicholson ordered against the Islamic State cave complex. But how the largest American conventional weapon came to be deployed  some 16 years after Mr. Bush first vowed that Afghanistan would never again provide safe haven to terrorist groups plotting against the United States  says much about the difficulties of keeping that pledge. One year ago  after Islamic State insurgents seized a series of towns and villages in the east  American and Afghan Special Operations forces responded with Operation Hamza to take back the territory. In its initial stage  American commandos helped run the extremists from the area. But officers in the Afghan 201st Corps at the nearby Tactical Base Gamberi were reluctant to secure the territory to keep the extremists from returning. “They did not have the appetite to go into southern Nangarhar and fight Daesh ” said Maj. Richard Anderson  an American operations adviser to the 201st Corps  using another name for the Islamic State. During a fight a month earlier  the 201st Corps lost 16 men in one night. So General Nicholson ordered that the huge bomb be dropped on Achin. Though it did initially clear the area of Islamic State fighters  many have since returned. And Afghan troops have urged American commanders to simply drop more bombs instead of launching ground battles. “They said: ‘You dropped the MOAB. Why don’t you just drop another MOAB?’” Major Anderson recalled in an interview at Gamberi in August. None Eric Schmitt contributed reporting.

While Kurds hold most of the leadership positions  the S.D.F. is a majority Arab force now  engaged with the Americans in the fight against the Islamic State  mostly in Arab rather than Kurdish areas of Syria. “Arabs love Abdullah Ocalan too ” Mr. Kobani said  casting a glance at the portrait. “There’s nothing hidden from our side. Everything we do is obvious and clear to the world.” None Advertisement None Advertisement In the face of those daunting obstacles  the Kurds have been slowly and systematically building Rojava  knowing that eventually the war would end and the truly difficult job of managing the peace would begin. None None On a recent visit to the predominantly Arab city of Manbij  outside Rojava  strains between the Kurdish leadership and the Arab populace were clearly visible  despite official efforts to deny the problem. But there were also signs of acceptance. An Arab schoolteacher said most Arabs in the town were unhappy with what they see as a Kurdish government  but were afraid to speak out. For visiting journalists  it was difficult to speak to Arab residents without government minders insisting on being present. Many Arabs  the schoolteacher said  speaking on the condition of anonymity because he feared detention  have been particularly unhappy since the reported arrests in early January of two Arab men  whose bodies were found 17 days later  dumped on the highway outside town. Government officials at first promised journalists that they could visit family members of those who were killed  and also meet with a committee of Arab elders  set up to investigate the killings. The officials said both groups had absolved the Kurdish authorities of blame. But the visit to the families was denied  and while the meeting with the committee did take place  it happened only in front of half a dozen Kurdish officials. Reached independently later  at the village of Kabor Emo outside Manbij  the father of one of the victims had a different story. Advertisement “It was the democratic government  I blame the democratic government ” said the father  Muhammad Omar al-Masri  but then he broke off the interview as villagers became angry and agitated at visitors. Dealing with Arab populations is not the only problem that Mr. Ocalan presents for Kurdish aspirations. The group he leads from prison  the P.K.K.  is a designated terrorist organization to Western countries  including the Kurds’ American allies.

None “There’s a lot of people that do equate them with the P.K.K.  but I have not seen any indication of that in my dealings with them ” said Maj. Gen. James B. Jarrard  the American Special Operations commander in Syria and Iraq. The Kurdish forces have set up civilian governments that are often run by Arabs in areas where they predominate  and have successfully turned the S.D.F. into a majority Arab force  General Jarrard said. The result has been stable government  which has helped to turn sympathies away from the extremists  the general said  during a recent visit to the front lines near Manbij. Many independent observers disagree about the Y.P.G. “Everybody knows with a wink and a nod that it’s the P.K.K. ” said Joost Hilterman  a longtime observer of the Kurds with the International Crisis Group. “The Y.P.G. is an integral part of the P.K.K. command structure. They may be mostly Syrians  though not exclusively  but all are part of the P.K.K.” None But he also defended the P.K.K. and refused to describe it as a terrorist organization  one implicated in attacks that killed civilians. “That is not true now  maybe during the ’80s or ’90s  but then they agreed internationally to protect civilians and since then I didn’t hear of any attack on civilians.” Advertisement None At the Hassan al-Amin High School in Manbij  a group of Arab teenage boys gathered outside after classes were dismissed  so that people could join demonstrations in town against the Turkish attack on Afrin.

A waiter  Amine Belkacem  50  who was serving diners in a Moroccan restaurant  said he saw young people running away from the scene. He asked them what was going on  and they told him they had heard shots and fled. Mr. Belkacem said he then saw a man running down the street who tried to stab someone in a taxi. Jules  17  who refused to give his last name  was waiting in line outside a Japanese restaurant with his mother and aunt  when he heard shouts. He rushed inside the restaurant  where customers were already hiding under the tables. A few minutes later  he said  he saw three police officers rush toward the assailant  who took a knife out of his pants’ pocket. “I was so scared  I put my head on the floor ” Jules said  adding that he did not see what happened next. “I’m so shocked. I don’t know how I’ll be able to sleep tonight.” Milan Charollois  19  who lives on a street adjacent to where at least one of the stabbings took place  was coming home when people told him that a woman had been stabbed. He rushed to the scene and saw a woman he thought was probably in her 60s  who had been stabbed in her leg and near her neck. She was pale and people were gathered around her pressing their hands on her neck where blood was coming out  he said. Alexis Bergoin  24  was drinking wine with his mother and friends of hers on the terrace of a bistro when he saw police cars rushing to the street’s corners. The bar owner told all the guests to hide inside  and Mr. Bergoin rushed to the bathroom. After he heard gunshots  he went outside and saw the body of a man lying on the street. “Even the bar owners know what do to now. Actually  we all know what to do ” Mr. Bergoin said. The claim of responsibility  issued by the Islamic State’s Amaq News Agency  described the attacker as having carried out the violence “in response to calls to target coalition countries ” referring to the American-led coalition that is battling the Islamic State. That phrase is a reference to a speech by the group’s now-deceased spokesman  which incited followers around the world to carry out attacks wherever they found themselves  using any means  from knives to trucks. The inclusion of this phrase in the claim suggests the attacker was remotely inspired by ISIS  as opposed to dispatched by the group directly. None “All my thoughts go to the victims and the wounded of the knife attack perpetrated tonight in Paris  as well as to their relatives ” he wrote. “I salute on behalf of all the French the courage of the policemen who have neutralized the terrorist.” He added: “France once again paid the price in blood but did not give an inch to the enemies of freedom.” None Since then France has tightened its terrorism laws  expanded intelligence collection  and its police and gendarmes have moved aggressively to halt attacks as quickly as possible. Prime Minister Édouard Philippe praised the quick reaction of the police to Saturday’s attack. “Within nine minutes after the first call  the assailant was neutralized ” Mr. Philippe said in a post on Twitter. “Our police forces have once again demonstrated their remarkable mastery and ability to intervene.” The security forces faced criticisms for not moving quickly enough to stop the attackers at the Bataclan concert hall in November 2015  where 90 people were killed.

Her childhood  however  was suffused with silence. In “When They Call You a Terrorist ” written with the journalist Asha Bandele  she remembers peering from behind a fence when her older brothers  then 11 and 13  were playing with their friends outside and a police car rolled up. The officers “throw them up on the wall. They make them pull their shirts up. They make them turn out their pockets. They roughly touch my brothers’ bodies.” Afterward her brothers tell no one. “They will be silent in the way we often hear of the silence of rape victims. They will be worried  maybe  that no one will believe them.” The book is subtitled “A Black Lives Matter Memoir ” but only the last quarter is devoted to the genesis of the movement in 2013 — when Khan-Cullors  along with Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi  landed on the phrase after George Zimmerman was acquitted for the 2012 murder of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. Most of this ruminative volume is instead about Khan-Cullors’s life as a child and a teenager  when the heavy pull of shame and sadness kept her tethered to a more private world of confusion and pain. Along with another new book  Jeanne Theoharis’s “A More Beautiful and Terrible History: The Uses and Misuses of Civil Rights History ” Khan-Cullors’s memoir provides another context for understanding Black Lives Matter. Theoharis gives us the historical background  located in the civil rights movement  Khan-Cullors gives us the personal background  located in her life. “Ours is a neighborhood designed to be transient  not a place where roots are meant to take hold ” Khan-Cullors writes. She grew up in Section 8 housing in Los Angeles  pouring water on her Honey Nut Cheerios instead of milk  which her family couldn’t afford. Less than a mile away was affluent Sherman Oaks  with its stately homes and two-car garages  where Khan-Cullors attended a gifted program in middle school. There’s a persistent longing that threads through this book — not so much for the consumerist dream represented by Sherman Oaks  but for the secure relationships she saw her wealthy  white classmates taking for granted. Their parents had the time to drive them to school and the easy optimism to ask them what they wanted to be when they grew up. She is confounded when her classmate’s father asks the same question of her. “It is incredible ” she writes  accessing her startled middle-school self. “Who asks children such things and over a well-set table where all the family has gathered to eat  converse?” Her own mother would leave home by 6 a.m. to work her three jobs and return after 10 at night. “All my life  as a witness to my mother’s life  I’d known love to be expressed as labor.” As a black  queer woman  Khan-Cullors is the kind of activist conservative politicians get panicky about  though they ostensibly share with her an overlapping area of concern. While they extol the importance of family and community (in word if not always in policy)  Khan-Cullors sees the cultivation of family and community as central to what she does  too. None None None None Each chapter of Theoharis’s book presents a historical narrative that is largely unknown outside scholarly books  or otherwise unsung. Several of them are pointed indictments of Northern self-congratulation. Theoharis delves into the stubborn persistence of segregated schools in New York City  as well as “the redneckification of racism ” wherein white liberals in the North could use naked displays of racism in the South as an excuse to let their own discriminatory systems off the hook. She shows how Southerners eventually learned to use the “veiled language” of Northerners to cloak deeply unequal policies in the seemingly neutral vocabulary of rights and individualism. Theoharis takes her book’s title from James Baldwin  who described American history as “longer  larger  more various  more beautiful and more terrible than anything anyone has ever said about it.” At bewildering moments like this one  it’s clarifying to read a history that shows us how little we remember  and how much more there is to understand.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/20/world/asia/kashmir-kamran-yousuf-photographer.html,Journalist or Terrorist? Kashmir Photographer Is Jailed  Pending Answer Advertisement Supported by None SRINAGAR  Kashmir — He is known as one of Kashmir’s gutsiest news photographers covering the intensifying hostility in his home region  and when violence broke out he was always among the first to the scene. But the photographer  Kamran Yousuf  21  has been stuck in jail since September — the victim  his friends and family say  of the Indian authorities’ strange and harsh definition of what a “real” journalist is. Those officials insist that Mr. Yousuf is part of an international terrorist gang conspiring to wage war against the Indian security forces in Kashmir. They said he could not possibly be a journalist because he never takes any pictures of government developmental projects or the inaugurations of hospitals  schools or bridges. Journalists have rallied to Mr. Yousuf’s cause  claiming that the charges have been cooked up and that he is being punished simply for what he covered: explosive antigovernment protests and militant activity  two real forces that have been haunting Kashmir for years. “It’s absurd ” said Syed Shujaat Bukhari  one of Kashmir’s most senior journalists. “Kamran’s a genuine journalist  and it’s not a government agency’s business to tell a journalist what to report or not report.” For decades  Kashmir has been the subject of a brutal territorial dispute between India  which controls much of the territory  and Pakistan. It lies right on the border  and tens of thousands of people have died here among the ruggedly beautiful mountain slopes and endless apple orchards. The conflict ebbs and flows  but in the past few years  Mr. Bukhari said  the predominant feelings among many young Kashmiris have hardened from “anti-India to hate India.” Mr. Yousuf  who hails from a small  apple-growing town  dropped out of college to document Kashmir’s conflict. He is tall and thin  with thick black hair and a black goatee on a cherubic face. “Hungry” is the first word his friends use to describe him. He could often be seen racing around on his grandfather’s motorbike  backpack stuffed with camera gear  business cards  notepads and wires  getting to the action often before anyone else. He is known for his pictures of fiery riots  militant funerals and smashed-up cars. Though young and relatively new to journalism  he had already become a specialist in capturing rage. And his friends say that is why the security services went after him. None None Mr. Yousuf has been charged as a stone-thrower. The National Investigation Agency  a counterterrorism force that in some ways is similar to the F.B.I.  is accusing him of being part of a “well-planned criminal conspiracy” run by terrorists in Pakistan to wage war against India. Kashmiri journalists say the accusation is ridiculous. Still  if the intent of Mr. Yousuf’s arrest was to intimidate journalists  it is already working. Mohammad Abu Bakar  another young Kashmiri photographer  said he has taken fewer pictures of stone-throwing and more of dry official events. He recently showed up at a news conference about the arrest of a drug dealer  which he said made for a very boring picture. “I know the pictures won’t be used  but I want to show them that I’m here  don’t worry  I’m on your side ” he said. Mr. Yousuf worked as a freelancer  making a few hundred dollars during good months. His freelance colleagues said that the newspapers that used many of his photos have abandoned him  declining to pay for his legal fees or to help his family. Kashmir’s rank-and-file journalists have taken to printing posters that say: “I am Kamran Yousuf. I am caged for fair journalism.” While the Indian authorities have lumped Mr. Yousuf in with a militant network they say is supported by Pakistan  they have also acknowledged in prosecution documents that Mr. Yousuf did not have any international phone numbers on his phone — and that he used it mostly to talk to his girlfriend. The investigators also seemed to have definite opinions about what journalists in Kashmir should be doing. They said that it was a journalist’s “moral duty” to “cover the activities and happenings (good and bad) in his jurisdiction” and that Mr. Yousuf had neglected to photograph government programs like skill-building workshops or blood drives. Alok Mittal  a spokesman for the National Investigation Agency  said investigators had “sufficient evidence” that Mr. Yousuf had participated in stone-throwing. He said the agency had “the highest regard for press freedom and there is no question of any intimidation to any journalist.” None On Wednesday  a judge in New Delhi  India’s capital  is scheduled to rule on whether Mr. Yousuf is entitled to bail. “We long for him to get out ” said his mother  Rubeena Tasin  who broke into tears just going through his backpack. When an uncle recently visited him in jail  Mr. Yousuf had a worrisome eye infection and looked thinner than usual. He also seemed stressed. “Every day I told him to leave the job  every day ” his mother said. “But he wanted to earn money. And get some fame.” Suhasini Raj contributed reporting from New Delhi.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/us/politics/bryant-neal-vinas-terrorism-cooperation-fbi-witness-protection.html,He Turned on Al Qaeda and Aided the U.S. Now He’s on Food Stamps and Needs a Job. Advertisement Supported by None Bryant Neal Vinas  a convicted terrorist from Long Island  showed up recently for dinner at Katz’s Delicatessen on the Lower East Side in oversize glasses with black rims  a thin attempt to alter his appearance. After he was released from federal prison last year  Mr. Vinas assumed he would have no need for a disguise. He thought he was going into witness protection  with a home far away and a new identity  after he helped the American government battle Al Qaeda as one of the most important cooperators in the government’s fight against terrorism. Captured in 2008 after training for months at Qaeda camps  Mr. Vinas quickly turned on his fellow jihadists and began helping American investigators dismantle the group. Even the federal judge who sentenced him described his cooperation as “remarkable.” “I helped them kill my friends ” Mr. Vinas explained while eating pastrami on a hoagie roll with mayonnaise  his choice of condiment drawing a weird look from his lawyer and the waiter. He added  “If that doesn’t show how you’re willing to turn your life around  I don’t know what will.” But the government decided against giving him protection  and Mr. Vinas  35  has found himself unexpectedly back in New York  where he was raised and converted to Islam more than a decade ago. The F.B.I. and the Justice Department declined to comment  but a senior government official said there were concerns about whether Mr. Vinas would adapt to the program and potential conflicts with law enforcement officials who administer the witness protection program. Nonetheless  the decision could affect future government cases as defense lawyers weigh whether to help prosecutors. The F.B.I. and federal prosecutors have long relied on informants to build cases against mob bosses  crooked Wall Street traders and drug dealers  and current and former law enforcement officials questioned whether potential cooperators would decline to help the government without a guarantee of safety in return. “How often do you get an American who went into Al Qaeda?” asked Jack Cloonan  a former F.B.I. agent who investigated the group. “I would think you would want to do everything you could for him. If I were the agent  I would be hard-pressed to accept this.” In a series of interviews  his first since being freed  Mr. Vinas gave an unusually revealing look at life inside Al Qaeda. He spoke of a training camp  where he slept in flea-ridden sleeping bags but befriended other young men from around the world  and gained access to Qaeda leaders  who discussed with him the most effective ways to cause mass destruction inside the United States. He suggested blowing up the Long Island Rail Road  or a Walmart. None Mr. Vinas had few prospects and even less money  and had grown distant from his family. As the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq dragged on  he grew to hate American foreign policy and thought he had a moral and religious obligation to defend Muslims. Fighting in Afghanistan  he thought  would give him a purpose. “If I had had a future  it would have been different ” he said. He traveled to Lahore  Pakistan  in 2007 and eventually linked up with militants who provided training and took him to Afghanistan. Six months later  Mr. Vinas was living at a safe house in Waziristan  a tribal area in northwest Pakistan  with Qaeda recruits from Egypt  Kuwait  Turkey and Saudi Arabia. By March 2008  Mr. Vinas had begun basic training at a Qaeda camp in northwest Pakistan. The living arrangements were primitive  trainees had to share the flea-infested sleeping bags. The food — rice  potato stew and boiled roots — gave him diarrhea and dysentery. He met many Qaeda leaders  including Saleh al-Somali  the chief of external operations  who planned an attack on New York’s subways that the F.B.I. thwarted. In a conversation with Younis al-Mauritani  a senior Qaeda member  Mr. Vinas suggested bombing the Long Island Rail Road as a way to hurt the New York economy. “It was just an idea that was talked about ” Mr. Vinas recalled. He also advised attacking a Walmart  but the idea was dismissed. Mr. Vinas made friends easily  like a Pakistani who had lived in Texas and loved barbecue and the Grateful Dead. Mr. Vinas’s closest friend was a gregarious 6-foot-5  300-pound Kuwaiti who enjoyed American fast food and spoke excellent English. Mr. Vinas said his friend wanted to be a suicide bomber because it was “one click to paradise.” But Al Qaeda instead made him work on its newsletter. As much as Al Qaeda hated the West  he said  the group’s fighters enjoyed its exports  like Pepsi and Danish yogurt. He said Mr. Somali raved about McDonald’s and Hardee’s. Many of the people he met died in drone strikes. The Pakistani authorities arrested Mr. Vinas in October 2008 in the Hayatabad neighborhood of Peshawar  where he had traveled to find a wife. The Pakistanis interrogated him  he said  and notified the American government that he had been caught. Mr. Vinas recalled thinking that he would be sent to the United States military prison at Guantánamo Bay  Cuba. Instead  he was flown to Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan and then to New York to be prosecuted. “It was a long trip ” Mr. Vinas said  and members of the F.B.I.-led Joint Terrorism Task Force took him to Katz’s after his arrest. “A pastrami sandwich can really soften a hard heart ” Mr. Vinas said. He immediately started providing information to the F.B.I. and pleaded guilty in 2009 to federal terrorism charges. None Mr. Vinas spent eight years at Otisville. In all  he took part in 100 interviews  reviewed 1 000 photographs and helped in more than 30 law enforcement investigations  according to prosecutors. Prosecutors have said he was the “single most valuable cooperating witness” about Qaeda activities spanning his time in Afghanistan and Pakistan. None Federal prosecutors as well as the F.B.I. agents who handled the case pushed hard for witness protection  said Steve Zissou  Mr. Vinas’s lawyer  who believes that Mr. Vinas remains in danger. “That’s not what we do to people who help the United States ” he said. “Vinas paid his dues. At the minimum  he should be given an opportunity to rebuild his life and be safe and secure.” “He never hurt anybody ” Mr. Zissou continued. The information that cooperators provide on people and places beyond the F.B.I.’s reach helps the bureau make cases it likely could not otherwise. “Cooperators are critical because you need an insider’s view ” said Christopher LaVigne  a former federal terrorism prosecutor in Manhattan. “It’s almost essential at terrorism trials. There’s only so much you can obtain and use from overseas.” The government  he said  has to live up to its obligations: “Cooperation is a two-way street.” None Mr. Zissou dismissed the assessment. “He’s not a threat to anybody ” Mr. Zissou said. Another psychologist evaluated Mr. Vinas after his release and said he was not a danger  but the Office of Enforcement Operations did not change its decision. The F.B.I. put him in an extended-stay hotel in New York. Farbod Azad  the F.B.I. agent on his case  once brought him Fruity Pebbles and milk. Mr. Vinas thought that was a nice gesture  but then Mr. Azad said the F.B.I. was done paying for the room. Another government agency paid for another month  Mr. Zissou said  and then Mr. Vinas was sent to what is known as a three-quarters house in New York. He wears an ankle monitor and has a curfew. Mr. Vinas is now on food stamps and Medicaid. He does odd jobs for his lawyer and has had little luck finding a job. He applied to Uber Eats but never heard back. He considered washing windows  but the union said it was not accepting applications. Mr. Vinas realizes he cannot escape what he did. He is still hopeful about his future  but he knows he will not be living anonymously. Perhaps what happened is a blessing. “I don’t have to hide anymore ” he said. “And I am not going to live in fear.” None None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,terrorism

Rape  sexual slavery  forced marriage and torture were central to its military and governing strategies. Iraq’s existing criminal laws cannot provide justice for these crimes. For example  the rape law requires survivors to show lack of consent  there is no definition of slavery  forced marriage is rarely prosecuted  and torture is narrowly linked to obtaining confessions. Even worse  Iraq has no laws prohibiting or punishing genocide  crimes against humanity and war crimes. If prosecuted under Iraq’s penal code  basic crimes of ISIS’ gender-based violence will go unpunished. To be sure  justice for ISIS’ victims will require more than just prosecutions under perfect laws and must also include truth-seeking  reparations and legal reform.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/09/world/middleeast/iraq-isis-islamic-state-arrest.html,Five Top ISIS Officials Captured in U.S.-Iraqi Sting Advertisement Supported by None BAGHDAD — Five senior Islamic State officials have been captured  including a top aide to the group’s leader  in a complex cross-border sting carried out by Iraqi and American intelligence  two Iraqi officials said Wednesday. The three-month operation  which tracked a group of senior Islamic State leaders who had been hiding in Syria and Turkey  represents a significant intelligence victory for the American-led coalition fighting the extremist group and underscores the strengthening relationship between Washington and Baghdad. Two Iraqi intelligence officials said those captured included four Iraqis and one Syrian whose responsibilities included governing the Islamic State’s territory around Deir al-Zour  Syria  directing internal security and running the administrative body that oversees religious rulings. Iraq’s external intelligence agency published a statement confirming the arrests  but did not mention any details of the role played by the Americans or the Turks. The two Iraqi intelligence officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details that had not been made public. Turkey did not immediately comment on the operation. The White House and the C.I.A. declined to comment. The developments quickly took over many Iraqi news broadcasts on Wednesday night  with news anchors praising Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi for what the intelligence service called a “major victory.” The news came at an opportune time for Mr. Abadi  who faces a tight parliamentary race on Saturday. The two Iraqi officials said that they had been tracking several of their targets for months  but the breakthrough came at the start of the year. An Iraqi intelligence unit responsible for undercover missions had tracked an Iraqi man  Ismail Alwaan al-Ithawi  known by the nom de guerre Abu Zeid al-Iraqi  from Syria to the Turkish city of Sakarya  about 100 miles east of Istanbul  these officials said. Mr. Ithawi  described by the Iraqis as a top aide to the Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al- Baghdadi  had been in charge of fatwas  or religious rulings  in the Islamic State’s so-called caliphate. He was also in charge of the education curriculum  and was a member of the body that appointed security and administrative leaders for the Islamic State’s territory  which had included large parts of Iraq and Syria. He had been living in Turkey with his Syrian wife under his brother’s identity  one of these officials said. The Iraqis sent the Turks an intelligence file they had amassed on Mr. Ithawi  and the Turkish security forces arrested him on Feb. 15  and extradited him to Iraq  this official said. Iraqi and American intelligence officials then spent weeks interrogating him  learning the details and whereabouts of other ISIS leaders in hiding  the officials said. The American-led coalition used this information to launch an airstrike in mid-April that killed 39 suspected Islamic State members near Hajin  in the Deir al-Zour district of Syria  the second official said. The joint Iraqi-American intelligence team then set a trap  according to these officials. They persuaded Mr. Ithawi to contact several of his Islamic State colleagues who had been hiding in Syria and lure them across the border  the officials said. The Iraqi authorities were waiting  and arrested the group soon after they crossed the frontier  the officials said. Those arrested included Saddam al-Jammel  a Syrian who had been the head of the Islamic State territory around Deir al-Zour  and Abu Abdel al-Haq  an Iraqi who had been the head of internal security for the group. Two other Iraqis were also arrested  the officials said. Iraq’s state television broadcast images of four of the detainees. Wearing yellow prisoner jumpsuits  the men  some with long beards and some clean-shaven  explained in short statements their responsibilities in the Islamic State. Each appeared to be in good health. It was unclear where they were being held or whether they had been given access to a lawyer. Turkey made no public comment on the arrests  but frequently announces arrests of Islamic State suspects in Turkish cities. Last week  Turkish news media reported the capture of three people in Sakarya who were accused of being members of the Islamic State. The reports said one of the three was the group’s leader in Deir al-Zour. It is not known if those arrests were related to the arrest of Mr. Ithawi. Relations have been strained between Turkey and the United States recently  in particular over American support for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. But counterterrorism cooperation between the two countries remains close. Turkey  which was criticized for allowing jihadists from all over the world open access to Syria in the early years of the Syrian war  has closed its border and rounded up hundreds of suspected Islamic State members in Turkey over the past two years.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/06/opinion/trump-isis-syria-russia.html,Is Trump Sowing the Seeds for ISIS 2.0? Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor None Ms. di Giovanni is the author of “The Morning They Came for Us: Dispatches From Syria.” This article has been updated to reflect recent events. A few weeks ago  a Syrian friend of mine  Kassem Eid  came to talk to the class I teach at Columbia. Kassem comes from Moadhamiyeh  a suburb of Damascus that had been besieged  starved and bombed. One August morning in 2013  he woke early for his morning prayers. As he tried to go back to sleep  he heard air raid sirens. Then he heard his roommates screaming — they were being attacked with chemical weapons. None What surprised my students the most was Kassem’s enthusiastic support for President Trump’s past decisions in Syria. He praised his airstrikes in 2017  which President Obama had never ordered  launched in retaliation for Mr. Assad’s chemical attack on Khan Sheikhoun  which killed more than 70 people. On Friday  I called Kassem to find out his thoughts about President Trump’s decision  announced this week  to pull American troops from Syria  despite the Pentagon and others warning him that it will create a vacuum for Iran and Russia  both patrons of Mr. Assad. He was dismayed  but not surprised. The Americans had already seemed to lighten up on Mr. Assad. “I was brokenhearted to see how they let Assad massacre 2 000 people in less than two weeks ” he said  referring to the attacks on eastern Ghouta  which fell to Mr. Assad’s forces last month. “There were more chemical attacks  more atrocities. More people displaced from their homes. And no one did anything.” I called other friends in Syria  they all said the same thing. Mr. Trump is sending a clear message to Mr. Assad: As long as we can claim victory over the Islamic State  we don’t care what you do  or what Russia or Iran does. The message has already been received  in fact. In parts of Damascus  I was told  Iranian military officials are buying up real estate using Syrian businessmen as their front  turning it into an Iranian mini-fief within Syria. Their dream of an Iranian “land bridge” that allows them access to the Mediterranean is not quite there  but their influence will surely grow  as it has in neighboring Iraq. None It is no coincidence that Saturday’s deadly chemical attack on the suburb of Douma  which killed 49 people in the last rebel-held area  came a year after Mr. Trump’s airstrikes on Assad targets. Is this Mr. Assad — or “Animal Assad ” as Mr. Trump referred to him in a weekend tweet — sending a deadly message to Washington following the decision to pull out troops? Is it a way of Mr. Assad telling the international community that he can do whatever he wants  knowing he will never be punished? Realistically  the 2 000 American troops have not made a huge difference to the landscape of the war in terms of humanitarian assistance  because the United States never had a vested interest in protecting the Syrian population  the troops were not deployed in a way that  say  could ensure the delivery of food or medicine  or open up besieged towns. But the signal their sudden withdrawal sends to the Syrian people  especially the Syrian Kurds  and the rest of the world will be damning. Kassem told me that living under the Assad dictatorship for 40 years  the national ideology taught him and his friends that America was the devil. “We were taught that America was the enemy ” he said. “Then we figured out it was all propaganda. But after seven years of atrocities  do you know what my friends and people around the Middle East are saying? That America is the enemy again. Because they see the Russians bombing us and the United States doing nothing. Now they pull out — when they could have been our friend or ally.” Of course  Mr. Trump is not concerned about these things  his sole metric for success is defeating the Islamic State — though the vast majority of Syrian civilians were killed by Mr. Assad’s forces. But any claim of victory over the Islamic State is premature and naïve. As Kassem and others note  the seeds of “ISIS 2.0” are already planted in the thousands of angry people who have lost their families  their homes  their country. “When there are a million people dead ” Kassem said  “when most have lost everything  ISIS will say  ‘We told you so.’” Mr. Trump has said that with America gone  its regional allies  especially Israel and Saudi Arabia  should pick up the slack. But that could make things even worse. Israel has a long and complicated relationship with Syria  and it has shown little willingness to get more involved. And Mr. Trump is perhaps forgetting that Saudi Arabia is the birthplace of the hard-core Wahhabi branch of Islam  which has inspired jihadists around the globe and could turbocharge a revived Islamic State. As long as America has had troops in Syria  there was at least hope for a peaceful resolution to the war. Now the bottom is falling out. Kassem says he hears talk about the coming of the Mahdi  whom many Muslims believe will bring about Judgment Day  because the region is engulfed in chaos — a precondition for his arrival. “Everyone is talking end of days ” he says.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/22/world/middleeast/isis-arabs-attacks.html,ISIS Spokesman Calls for Attacks on Arab Nations Advertisement Supported by None In his first statement in 10 months  the Islamic State’s spokesman on Sunday called for violence against neighboring Arab nations  suggesting that the group’s focus was turning closer to home. The remarks were a departure from the last pronouncement issued by the spokesman  Abu Hassan al-Muhajir  which aimed to incite attacks against Europe and North America. It comes as the group is retrenching in its core territory after losing all but 3 percent of the area it once held in Iraq and Syria. In a nearly hourlong audio recording  released inside the group’s chat rooms in the messaging app Telegram  the spokesman called on fighters to redirect their ire toward the leaders of Arab nations in the region  whom he described as “apostates ” a term the group uses to refer to fellow Sunnis who have strayed from its extreme interpretation of the faith. The spokesman said there was “no difference” between fighting the leaders of Saudi Arabia  Egypt  Iran and the Palestinians “and their American Crusader allies  or the Russians or the Europeans.” He argued that they deserved to be treated even more harshly because “these are Arabs and are more fierce and vicious against Islam.” In the spokesman’s last speech  released in June of 2017  he recalled famous battles from early Islamic history in which Muslims prevailed despite being outnumbered  and called for lone-wolf-style attacks in Europe  including in Russia. The June recording echoed a much-quoted speech by the group’s original spokesman  Abu Muhammad al-Adnani  that was released in 2014 — the year ISIS pivoted from a regional threat to a global one. The 2014 speech was routinely quoted by attackers across the world as justification for their acts of violence  including in video wills left by the suicide bombers who blew themselves up at a stadium and concert hall in Paris in 2015. Now  it appears that the group’s canvas has shrunk and it is returning to its roots as a regional insurgency. None None But the group that went on to become ISIS disregarded this counsel from the beginning  dragging Iraq into a bloody sectarian conflict. None In Mr. al-Muhajir’s latest audio statement  he cited texts from the puritanical Wahhabi tradition to create a spiritual rationale for killing ever more Muslims — not just Shiites  but also Sunnis  whom ISIS claims to represent. None At the same time  the ISIS spokesman mocked the United States  taunting President Trump. Without naming him  Mr. al-Muhajir said America had lost its influence under the current administration. “Look at you  you evildoer  confused and lost  and with your goals scattered. You are now forced to beg and go along the wishes of your supposed adversaries ” he said  in an apparent reference to Russia. Nasser Weddady contributed reporting.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/09/world/asia/indonesia-isis-hostages.html,ISIS-Linked Indonesian Jail Riot Ends as Police Raid Cellblock Advertisement Supported by None JAKARTA  Indonesia — A riot and deadly two-day standoff by terrorism detainees in a police detention center near the Indonesian capital ended early Thursday after a police assault on the cellblock led to a mass surrender by those holed up inside  officials said. Explosions could be heard from the compound as a police counterterrorism unit known as Detachment 88 fired tear gas and blew out walls in search of bombs made by a group of 156 terrorism suspects and convicted militants. Officials said that five guards and one detainee had been killed in the standoff at the detention center  in Depok  West Java Province. Most of the inmates in the section have been linked to the Islamic State  and the terrorist group’s media arm claimed responsibility for the uprising  posting images it said showed guards that the detainees had taken hostage and then killed. Indonesia’s influential security minister  Wiranto  said that 145 of the detainees came out and surrendered  leaving 10 holed up inside. He said officers recovered 30 weapons that the detainees had taken from guards within the compound. Then officers stormed the cellblock  Mr. Wiranto said  using explosives  grenades and tear gas  and the remaining 10 detainees then surrendered  he said. Commissioner General Syafrudin  deputy chief of the Indonesian National Police  told reporters that some of the blasts heard from compound were from bombs that had been made by the detainees. “The blast sounds were part of our efforts to destroy any bombs inside  because they had made bombs ” General Syafrudin said. “For the next six hours  we will continue sterilization  and afterward  you journalists can go inside and look around.” He said the 155 detainees under scrutiny would all be transferred to the maximum-security prison island of Nusakambangan  off the south coast of Java Island  where the convicts considered to be the most dangerous are all sent. Gen. Mohammad Iqbal  a National Police spokesman  told reporters that the riot erupted late Tuesday at the detention center. Even as the riot was unfolding  the Islamic State’s propaganda arm uploaded videos and photos that it claimed were from inside the detention center  showing executed hostages and detainees brandishing weapons  raising the black flag of the Islamic State and pledging allegiance to the group’s leader. But initially  Indonesian officials denied that Islamic State loyalists had been behind the uprising. “The trigger is trivial: complaints about food ” General Iqbal said in the early hours of the standoff on Wednesday. There was a riot at the same police detention center last November  when terrorist detainees fought with guards during a search for contraband  including cellphones. They took photos and video of themselves brandishing Islamic State flags. According to the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict  a Jakarta-based research organization  the large population of terrorism suspects and convicts in the detention center has long been “a disaster waiting to happen.” In a report the institute released in February  “we said it was A: overcrowded  and B: there was no effort at all to counsel the newly arrived detainees  and they were almost all pro-ISIS ” Sidney Jones  the institute’s director  said in an interview on Wednesday. Ms. Jones  a prominent terrorism analyst  said the November 2017 riot was a warning to the authorities  who then began moving the most violent or radicalized convicts on terrorism charges to Nusakambangan. None Last week  the police in West Java arrested three men who were accused of planning a suicide bombing on the Police Headquarters where the detention center is. Indonesia has suffered numerous terrorist attacks in recent years  including bombings on Bali in 2002 and 2005  and international hotels in Jakarta in 2003 and 2009.

Schools have closed and thousands of children are affected. At least 224 primary schools and 42 secondary schools in Wajir County can no longer function after non-local teachers fled. The exodus was caused by the Feb. 16 al-Shabab attack on a primary school in which two non-Muslim teachers were killed. Kenya's Teachers Service Commission transferred 329 teachers elsewhere for their safety. Many others left on their own. In all  917 non-Muslim primary school teachers have left the region. It is the largest-ever mass exodus of teachers from the region  observers say. Analysts say the extremist group threatens gains in education in a region that until recently was the most marginalized in Kenya and has been described as a hotbed for recruitment for extremist groups  which oppose Western education. Children out of school become easy targets. For al-Shabab the closure of schools will be seen as ""a success "" said Abdullahi Boru Halakhe  an expert in countering violent extremism. ""Schools and education is one of the antidotes against the narratives of the (extremist) group. Thus  if you close the school  how else can you build a counter-narrative?"" he asked. Al-Shabab has carried out a wave of attacks in Kenya since 2011  calling it retribution for Kenya sending troops to Somalia to fight the extremists. Attacks include the April 2015 raid on Garissa University that left 147 people dead. Teachers near the Somali border have been targeted  including in a November 2014 attack on a bus in neighboring Mandera County. Some 120 non-Muslim teachers have left their posts in Mandera County due to the latest insecurity. The teachers have been sleeping in the Kenya National Union of Teachers boardroom for nearly two months and spend their days camped out at the offices of their employer  the Teachers Service Commission. Police routinely use tear gas on them as they protest and demand better protection from the extremist threat. ""We have asked the government to transfer teachers where they feel safe "" said the union's secretary-general  Wilson Sossion. The threat of attack is not the only problem non-Muslim teachers face in the predominantly ethnic Somali region  said Peter Amunga  an education activist. Discrimination by the local community and radicalized students are other challenges. Non-Muslims make up 90 percent of the teachers in the border areas as marginalization and nomadic culture have limited the number of local ones  he said. Wangechi Nderitu  one of the teachers camping out at the Teachers Service Commission offices  said one student at a neighboring school who was punished by teachers went to train with al-Shabab in Somalia for two years then returned in late 2015  took his father's gun and went after the teachers. Luckily they had been transferred  he said. Despite teachers' concerns the government has forced them to stay in the region without providing additional security  Nderitu said. He said his bank accounts had been frozen and that the Teachers Service Commission says they won't be released until he and his colleague go back to work. ""This is blackmail "" Nderitu said. ""That's why we are stranded here. The Teacher Service Commission did not respond to a request for comment. The government's response has been sub-optimal  said Halakhe  the expert in countering extremism. ""While there is an acknowledgement that there are no easy answers to what is obviously a complex and complicated problem  the government has failed even to do even the basic like  for instance  stationing security officers at some of the schools "" he said. Al-Shabab has exploited the region's history of marginalization for recruiting and propaganda  he added. The region's attempt to secede and join Somalia in the 1960s was quashed with military force and successive governments neglected the area until Kenya's new constitution in 2010 ensured that all regions received resources for development. ""In this latest situation  al-Shabab could say to the potential recruits: 'Look  your government cannot even provide you with a modicum of security  come and join us '"" Halakhe said. Kenya's Parliament has approved a government plan to hire 88 000 teachers to address a nationwide shortfall of more than 104 000. For Wajir County  Education Secretary Amina Mohamed has said 1 200 teaching assistants will be recruited to step in until replacements are found. If those replacements are not from the region  however  they soon will seek transfers as well  said Sossion with the teachers' union. A ""permanent solution"" would be to train more locals who are ethnic Somali and Muslim  he said. For Bashir  the 12-year-old student  the politics surrounding the school closures doesn't matter. ""Now that there is no more class  what will I do with all this time?"" he asked The Associated Press. Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ",terrorism

Col. Pramote Prom-in of the Internal Security Operations Command said 10 defendants had originally received death sentences on Monday from the Pattani Provincial Court. Because of their cooperation  three had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment and another to 40 years in prison. The prosecutors had charged the defendants for five bombings between June and December 2016 in Pattani and possession of pistols and bomb-making materials. Thailand's three southernmost provinces of Pattani  Yala and Narathiwat have been plagued for over a decade by Muslim insurgents seeking autonomy from predominantly Buddhist Thailand. More than 6 500 people have been killed in the violence since 2004. It is unclear if the convicted men will be put to death  since Thailand has apparently not carried out a death sentence in more than eight years. However  just over a month ago it saw another case in which six men were sentenced to death in one case in southern Thailand for the massacre of eight members of one family  including three children  over a land and loan dispute. Several defendants in the case in Krabi province had pleaded guilty to some charges  which would normally result in a reduction of their sentence  but the court said it did not commute the sentences because the crime was ""deeply upsetting and causing public fear.""

An Agence France-Presse photographer and a cameraman for the local Tolo TV station were among the fatalities  police said. Two reporters for the Afghan branch of Radio Free Europe and a third who was to begin working there soon also were killed  Radio Free Europe said. At least 45 people were wounded in the attacks  according to Kabul police spokesman Hashmat Stanekzai  who said four police were among those killed. The attack was the latest in a relentless string of large-scale bombings and assaults in the capital and elsewhere in Afghanistan this year.

The children had gathered around the NATO convoy for fun when the bomber struck  said Abdul Rahim Ayubi  a lawmaker from Kandahar. Eight Romanian NATO soldiers were wounded. The Islamic State group claimed the Kabul bombings in a statement posted online  saying it targeted the Afghan intelligence headquarters. The statement did not say anything about specifically targeting journalists. The blasts took place in the central Shash Darak area  home to NATO headquarters and a number of embassies and foreign offices — as well as the Afghan intelligence service. Stanekzai said the first suicide bomber was on a motorbike  while the second targeted those scrambling to the scene to aid victims. He said the second attacker was on foot in a crowd of reporters  pretending to be a member of the press  when he set off his payload. AFP said the news agency's chief photographer in Kabul  Shah Marai  was among those killed. Hundreds of people attended his funeral later on Monday.

In a separate attack in the eastern Khost province  a 29-year-old reporter for the BBC's Afghan service was shot dead by unknown gunmen. The BBC confirmed the death of Ahmad Shah  saying he had worked for its Afghan service for more than a year. BBC World Service Director Jamie Angus called it a ""devastating loss."" Survivors of the attacks in Kabul recounted scenes of mayhem.

IS and the more firmly established Taliban carry out regular attacks  with the Taliban usually targeting the Afghan government and security forces  and IS targeting the country's Shiite minority  whom the militants view as apostates. The relentless assaults underscore the struggles that Afghan security forces have faced since the United States and NATO concluded their combat mission at the end of 2014. Both armed groups want to establish strict Islamic rule in Afghanistan. Last week  an Islamic State suicide bomber attacked a voter registration center in Kabul  killing 60 people and wounding at least 130 others.

Officials were also able to connect the pink gloves Mr. Conditt is seen wearing at the FedEx store with a purchase he made  also caught on surveillance footage  at a Home Depot. None None Officers followed Mr. Conditt  who stopped the truck he was driving in a ditch off Interstate 35. Officials said he blew himself up inside his vehicle as SWAT officers approached him on foot. An old military device donated to a Goodwill store went off in an employee’s hands  injuring a man in his 30s and setting off another scare in a city on edge. But the police said that they had “no reason to believe this incident is related to earlier package bombs.” A package bomb was discovered at a FedEx facility near Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in the morning. It was the first time one of the serial bomber’s devices was recovered unexploded. None None Two men in their 20s were seriously injured in an explosion of a package bomb that was left on the side of the road. Austin police chief Brian Manley said that the bomb was possibly triggered by tripwire strung across a sidewalk  unlike the three earlier bombings. “The belief that we are now dealing with someone who’s using tripwires shows a higher level of sophistication  a higher level of skill ” Chief Manley said. A mother was critically injured and her 17-year-old son was killed when she opened a package bomb in her kitchen after bringing it in from the front porch. The explosion occurred at about 6:45 a.m. At around 11:50 a.m.  a 75-year-old Hispanic woman was seriously injured when she picked up a package bomb left outside her house  just a few miles away from the attack earlier that day. At about 6:55 a.m. on March 2  Anthony Stephan House  39  was killed after he handled a box left on his front porch. None All three episodes involved cardboard packages that were left on doorsteps overnight. None of the packages were delivered through the Postal Service or any other delivery services. After the fourth bombing  which involved a tripwire  the Austin police connected it to the first three. “We are clearly dealing with what we expect to be a serial bomber at this point  based on the similarities between now what is the fourth device ” Chief Manley said The F.B.I. confirmed on Tuesday night that the fifth and sixth bombs  which were located at FedEx facilities  were also connected to the earlier bombs. These packages  however  signaled a change in tactics — instead of being left on doorsteps or triggered by tripwires  they were shipped. Both packages were mailed from the same FedEx store in Sunset Valley  a small city within Austin. Both packages were being sent to Austin as well. A statement from FedEx suggested that the packages were sent by the same person. The package that exploded at the FedEx center outside San Antonio contained shrapnel like the packages that exploded in Austin  a law enforcement official said. The bombings in Austin have alarmed black leaders because the two people killed were African-American males and the seriously wounded victim was a 75-year-old Hispanic woman. Anthony Stephan House Draylen William Mason The two males who were killed were members of families with deep roots in the city’s black  religious and civil rights groups.

On Sunday  a car bomb exploded at a security checkpoint near the Interior Ministry on a road leading to the presidential palace in the capital  Mogadishu. At least three people  in addition to the bomber  were killed  a police chief said. The blast sent a plume of black smoke billowing above the skyline. The police chief  Gen. Bashir Mohamed Jama  said that five other people had been injured in the blast and that the authorities had thwarted two other suicide bombing attacks on Sunday morning. The Shabab  an Islamist extremist group affiliated with Al Qaeda  claimed responsibility for the attack  saying it had killed 13 members of the security forces  although that could not be independently verified. The group  which has been behind bombings and other attacks in Mogadishu  aims to topple Somalia’s Western-backed federal government. Earlier on Sunday  another car bomb exploded in Siinka Dheer  outside Mogadishu  but the toll was not immediately clear. Some reports said that one person had been killed  along with the driver. Mogadishu’s mayor  Abdirahman Omar Osman  also known as Yariisow  condemned the attacks  saying  “These terror acts will not stop us.” Dr. Abdulkadir Adan  from Mogadishu’s only emergency services unit  said  “Our vehicles and rescue teams immediately reached the Sayid checkpoint to rescue civilian injured at the scene.” Mohamed Abdulle  a resident of Mogadishu  said in a phone interview on Sunday  “I personally saw and counted the deaths of three people  they were civilians.” He added  “I could also see many motorbikes and cars  which were completely burned and destroyed by the blast.” The explosions occurred days after a bomb went off outside the Weheliye Hotel in the city  killing at least 14 people  mostly young entrepreneurs  and injuring at least 10 others on Thursday afternoon  according to the police and rescue services. Abdiasis Ali Ibrahim  the spokesman for the internal security minister  confirmed the death toll to the state-run Radio Mogadishu. The Shabab also claimed responsibility for that attack. The second car bomb on Sunday was detonated at a checkpoint after soldiers stopped a suspicious vehicle  a senior police captain  Mohamed Hussein  told The Associated Press. Those who died included two soldiers  he said  while many of the nearly 10 people wounded were rickshaw drivers. Officer Mohamed Abdi told The A.P. that the earlier explosion that day had occurred after soldiers inspected another “suspicious” car that was stuck on a road in the Siinka Dheer area.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/world/middleeast/iraq-baghdad-isis-bombing.html,ISIS Claims Responsibility for Baghdad Bombings Advertisement Supported by None None None But the statement released on the messaging app Telegram had a number of errors  including the location of Monday’s attack. It said that it had occurred at Aden Square in Baghdad  where the police said an attack was foiled on Saturday  rather than in Tayaran Square  where Monday’s explosions took place. That error  and the delay in issuing a claim of responsibility  suggests that the Islamic State’s media apparatus has been disrupted in the period since the group lost nearly 98 percent of its territory in Iraq and Syria. In addition  the Islamic State  also known as ISIS  said that there were three attackers  not two. The communiqué identified them by code names  and said that the first two detonated their explosive vests in quick succession  while the third hit another gathering in the same area sometime after the first two explosions  according to a translation of the statement provided by SITE Intelligence Group. In its statement  ISIS identified the open-air market that was attacked as a gathering of “rafidha” and of “polytheists ” two words they use to refer to Shiite Muslims in a derogatory manner. The first term  derived from the Arabic root meaning “to reject ” is a reference to the fact that members of the Shiite branch of Islam chose to follow a different lineage from the one followed by Sunnis after the death of the Prophet Muhammad. The second refers to the group’s view that Shiites have strayed from Islam’s monotheistic creed because of the reverence they show for historical figures  like Imam Ali. Of note is the length of time it took for the Islamic State to issue its claim of responsibility. While the group has sometimes taken days to claim responsibility for attacks outside Iraq and Syria  it is unusual for ISIS to delay announcements for an attack in Baghdad  which may suggest a weakening of the group’s media arm.

Grace Paul. Rebecca Joseph. Mary Ali. Ruth Kolo. And so many others. It took Nigerian officials agonizing weeks to publish the names of all the students Boko Haram kidnapped from a boarding school in the village of Chibok four years ago  on the night of April 14. Once they did  the numbers were staggering. The list quickly circulated among the grieving parents searching for their daughters  some setting out on motorbikes to confront the Islamist militants who had stormed the school  loaded the girls into trucks and hauled them away at gunpoint. Soldiers used the list  too  as they combed the countryside for the missing students  marching through the forest  dispatching jets and enlisting the help of foreign militaries. Negotiators checked the names as they bartered with militants for the girls’ release. And the list became an inspiration for protesters hundreds of miles away in the capital  who kept marching for the girls’ return  day after day. “As I began to read each name  my resolve strengthened ” said Oby Ezekwesili  a former education minister who led protests. “They were not just statistics. These were real human beings.” Far away in America  France  South Korea and elsewhere  public figures and celebrities joined the cause. Bring back our girls  they all demanded. For years  the teenagers remained missing  changing from girls into women  lost to a band of extremists known for beating  raping and enslaving its captives. And then  many of their names were joyfully crossed off the list. “I’m ‘back ’ as they say ” said Hauwa Ntakai  one of the Chibok students. Nearly four years after they were abducted and dragged off to a forest hide-out  more than 100 of the students from Chibok now live on a pristine university campus four hours from their homes here in northeastern Nigeria  their days filled with math and English classes  karaoke and selfies  and movie nights with popcorn. The government negotiated for the release of many of the Chibok students  who were set free in groups over the last year and a half. A few others were found roaming the countryside  having escaped their captors. But more than 100 of their former classmates are still missing  held by Boko Haram. About a dozen are thought to be dead. “I’m happy ” said Ms. Ntakai  who was No. 169 on the list. Now  she is a 20-year-old student who rises at dawn for Saturday yoga class and argues about the benefits and dangers of social media during debate night at the university. “But I’m thinking about my sisters who are still in the back ” in Boko Haram’s clutches  she said. 64 Martha James Bello  177 Rachel Nkeki  142 Mary Yakubu 195 Maryam Bashir 45 Salomi Titus 20 Hauwa Abuga 175 Helen Musa 49 Rakiya Gali 149 Mwa Daniel  34 Tabitha Silas 88 Liyatu Kwanta Simon 185 Ruth Amos 187 Martha James 189 Maryamu Lawan  137 Palmata Musa  24 Comfort Habila 69 Ruth Kolo 86 Rebecca Mallum 122 Liyatu Habila  139 Glory Dama 79 Victoria William 21 Naomi Luka 163 Juliana Yakubu  None Weeks before the Chibok kidnapping  a group of young boys were burned alive in their own school  a tragedy that failed to resonate around the world in the same way as the mass abduction of the schoolgirls. The vast majority of Boko Haram’s victims will remain anonymous and unaccounted for  their names never broadcast across the globe. Many of their families will never even know what happened to them. The crimes committed against them occur in remote areas  far from the reach of cellphone networks  and often while the world’s attention is elsewhere. But the Chibok girls had names. Saratu Ayuba. Ruth Amos. Comfort Habila. Esther Usman. None 96 Rahab Ibrahim After negotiating with the government  Boko Haram released 21 Chibok students in 2016. Ms. Ibrahim was one of them. Teenage students from a village school suddenly became the unwitting representatives of all the dead and missing victims of a crisis that has upended a poor  remote corner of the globe. They became the daughters of Nigeria  and more broadly daughters of the whole world  embraced and fretted over as though they belonged to everyone. “When the Chibok abduction happened  it was the articulation of this whole saga ” said Saudatu Mahdi  a co-founder of the Bring Back Our Girls movement. “They became a rallying point.” But the freed students from Chibok also bear the heavy burden of the celebrity that led to their release. They are fortunate enough to attend a private university that educates the children of Nigerian politicians  businesspeople and other members of the elite. But security restrictions on the Chibok students are especially tight. They are not allowed to leave campus without an escort. They can’t have visitors without special permission. And though some of the women gave birth during their captivity  their children are not allowed to stay with them at the university. Administrators say that would distract from their studies. In fact  the young women have rarely seen their families since they were freed from Boko Haram. The longest period they have spent with their parents  siblings and other relatives since their abduction in 2014 was over Christmas break last year  when they went home for a couple of weeks. Other than that  they have been under close supervision by officials and educators. As soon as they were released from Boko Haram  the women were whisked to Abuja  the capital  where they spent weeks in the government’s custody  questioned for information that could help find their still-missing classmates — and to satisfy officials that they had not grown loyal to Boko Haram. Security agents warned the young women not to talk about their time with militants  arguing that it might jeopardize the safety of the students still held captive. Forget about the past and move forward  they were told. 106 Saratu Ayuba Last May  an additional 82 hostages were released. Ms. Ayuba was in that group. For months  their access to their parents was severely restricted. They weren’t allowed to leave the bland government building that was their dormitory. Even today  their only regular connection to their families is by phone. Last summer  officials at the American University of Nigeria traveled to Abuja to meet with the government. Back in 2014  the university  in the city of Yola  had taken in about 20 students from Chibok who had been kidnapped by Boko Haram but had managed to escape within hours. Administrators pitched the government on a plan to take the newly freed women  too. The idea was to incorporate them into a program designed to help them catch up on their studies  reunite them with their former classmates who were already at the university and prepare them for college life. Now the Chibok students’ lives are highly structured. With militants still at large in the country  they are considered high-profile targets. And as public figures  officials fear  they are vulnerable to exploitation. “They will not be the normal people they were before they were abducted ” said Ms. Mahdi  secretary general of the Women’s Rights Advancement and Protection Alternative  an advocacy group for women and girls in Nigeria. “A lot of restrictions will come with their lifestyle.” Officials at the university had no experience educating a large group of former hostages from a village school. But neither did anyone else. “We’ll take them all and figure it out ” the university’s president  Dawn Dekle  an American  recalled thinking at the time. “They were traumatized as a group. Their healing has to be in a group.” All but one of the newly freed students agreed to attend. She had already been married at the time she was kidnapped  so she went back to live on her farm near Chibok with her husband. At the university  officials scrambled to prepare for the students  renovating a dormitory so they all could be housed together and finding classrooms to accommodate the extra pupils. None 190 Deborah Andrawus  While the women now live on a university campus  studying English and preparing for college  they are ""free  but not really free."" Last September  more than 100 of the students arrived at the tidy campus  with its trimmed hedges  three-story library and solar-powered buildings. Not everyone was happy to welcome such a large group of women who had spent the past few years living with militants. Some of the other students were scared that Boko Haram would come for the Chibok women again  especially at a university representing the sort of Western education that Boko Haram has long condemned. Others worried that the women had grown attached to their captors and could be terrorists themselves. One student told officials that she feared waking up at night to discover one of the women holding a knife to her neck. After arriving on campus  the women were escorted to the university cafeteria for their first meal. The group drew stares from the other students. “I could tell they were not feeling comfortable ” said Reginald Braggs  a former United States Navy R.O.T.C. instructor who is in charge of the program for the Chibok students. Rather than force integration  administrators decided to let the new arrivals eat most meals in their dorm. All in their 20s now  the women are housed at the university  but in a program that sometimes seems designed for elementary students. Classrooms are decorated with pictures of Spider-Man and basic multiplication tables. “Remember to flush the toilet and wash your hands ” reads a poster on the bulletin board. For months  their tablets  all donated  were ordered turned off at night. Messages of positive thinking are plastered on every wall: Never give up. Believe in yourself. Shine like stars. When some of the women were upset at messing up during spelling bees  administrators gave them the words to study ahead of time. Even their church service  during which the women seemed relaxed and joyful as they sang and danced on a recent Sunday morning  is watered down. Raymond Obindu  a charismatic speaker who bounces beside the pulpit and uses an equally ebullient interpreter  keeps his sermons for the women more uplifting than the ones he delivers to his local congregation. “The Bible says you are fearfully and wonderfully made ” Mr. Obindu said during the service. “Everyone say  ‘I’m beautiful.’ ” “I’m beautiful ” the room of women chanted. He asked if anyone wanted to give thanks. “I thank God for leaving me alive ” said Magret Yama  who was released by Boko Haram last May. 36 Yana Joshua 104 Hauwa Ishaya 150 Luggwa Mutah  126 Hauwa Musa 181 Filo Dauda 161 Naomi Zakariya  90 Blessing Abana 33 Kauna Lalai  152 Saraya Yanga 124 Abigail Bukar 65 Awa Yirma 131 Grace Paul 27 Luggwa Sanda 151 Yana Bukar 22 Glory Maintah  115 Maryamu Musa 57 Amina Bulama 192 Grace Dauda None “They’ve seen hell together ” said Somiari Demm  the psychologist  who counsels the women  teaches them yoga and attends church services alongside them. “They share the extensive narrative that no one else does.” The women told their parents that they had endured periods of hunger while with Boko Haram. They were made to cook and clean for fighters. Some were raped. Some have shrapnel lodged under their skin. One is missing part of a leg from injuries suffered with Boko Haram. Ntakai Keki  60  said his daughter Hauwa had told him that the militants beat girls who disagreed with them or refused to follow orders. She was once lashed 30 times with a cane  he said. Hauwa had told him that she saw the dead bodies of children who were being held hostage and witnessed fighters die of wounds from aerial bombings by the military. “That has all ended now ” Mr. Keki said. Psychologically  Mr. Braggs said more than half of the women were in what he called the red zone. “They’re just sad or down ” he said. University officials do not let journalists ask the women about their experiences with the militants  arguing that it could traumatize them further. “They’re grown women by American standards ” Mr. Braggs said. “Even physically they are grown women. But look at their social development. They’re still very vulnerable.” “I’m very  very cautious about people thinking I’m overprotective ” he added. “I don’t think they’re children. But there’s a certain responsibility I’ve been given.” At the university  the women are instructed to speak only English  a language most of them struggle with (they grew up speaking Hausa and local languages). Other than a few staff members posted to their dorm  most of the people in charge of the women can’t communicate with them in their own languages — including the women’s psychologist  their teachers and the director  Mr. Braggs. A handful of the women speak English well. Some are using kindergarten-level phonics books. Yet most of the women’s counseling sessions are carried out in English  raising questions about the depth of their therapy. Ms. Demm contended that some of the Chibok students who had initially escaped the kidnapping had traveled to the United States  only to be exploited by people there. She said they were made to repeatedly recount the night Boko Haram came to their school  with their testimonies used to solicit donations for churches or other organizations. Ms. Demm argued that she wanted to empower the students in her care to tell their own stories  in their own time. For now  she said  the hardest adjustment for the women is “being free  but not really free.” Recently  one of the women  Glory Dama  learned that her father was being treated for an illness at a hospital not far from campus. She wanted to see him  so the university prepared to organize an escort for her. Before it happened  though  he was discharged and relatives drove him back to Chibok  without waiting for Ms. Dama to arrive. He died on the way. Ms. Dama was devastated  and as the news traveled through the group so were the other women. Activities were canceled for the rest of the day. The women  who spend their days in air-conditioned classrooms equipped with Wi-Fi  know that their current circumstances are vastly better than those of most people who have escaped or been freed from Boko Haram. None Ms. Dama wants to take university classes  return to Chibok and be a nurse to help her community. Another student  Rhoda Peter  wants to be a lawyer. “I know I’m in a place where nobody will chase me and do something wrong to us ” said Ms. Peter  22. “They are here to help us.” In February  about 170 miles from Chibok  the unfathomable happened again. None None The Nigerian government says it is negotiating for the release of the rest of the missing girls from Dapchi  as well as the dozens of students from Chibok who are still being held captive. Grace Hamman  a Chibok student who was released from Boko Haram last year  said she took comfort during her time in captivity in the knowledge that she hadn’t been forgotten. “I heard on the radio people were crying for us and were concerned ” she recalled. “I thank everyone for what they did for us.” The world knew them as teenagers  in dark robes with sad faces. We portrayed them in a different manner. These 18 girls were captured by militants in Nigeria and sent into crowds to blow themselves up.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/world/africa/nigeria-boko-haram-girls.html,Boko Haram Returns Dozens of Schoolgirls Kidnapped in Nigeria Advertisement Supported by None DAKAR  Senegal — Dozens of schoolgirls from the northern Nigerian community of Dapchi were returned early Wednesday morning  dropped off by the same group of Boko Haram militants who kidnapped them more than a month ago as they offered a stern warning to never go back to school again. The surprising turn of events was greeted with joy from parents whose daughters were safely returned  but the relief was tempered by suspicions that several girls had died while in the hands of the militants. At least one is apparently still being held. Jauro Usman  a resident of Dapchi who is close to many of the parents of the kidnapped girls  said those who had been reunited were “very  very happy.” “Boko Haram came themselves and dropped our daughters ” he said. None Initially  federal officials had stayed silent  and later local officials inaccurately told parents that the girls had been rescued  prompting a small riot by parents whose hopes were dashed. On Wednesday  the families were upset that the government wanted the girls to travel to Abuja  Nigeria’s capital  apparently for a debriefing by security officials  when their parents just wanted them home. American military officials have said they believe that the faction of Boko Haram responsible for the kidnapping was backed by the Islamic State  which has criticized the kidnapping of Muslim students. The student who is apparently still being held is a Christian. Her fellow captives have told their families that she refused militants who wanted her to convert to Islam. On Wednesday morning  the militants drove three of the girls to their homes in other villages  residents said. Others were delivered to a bus station along a freeway outside Dapchi. Bukar Usman  a resident of Dapchi  said he had shaken hands with the insurgents  who warned residents that girls should not be in school but should instead be married off. The militants threatened to return if the girls went back to school. Government officials said that at least 104 of the 110 girls who had been kidnapped had been returned  but that the total number of freed students was still being tallied. Another girl and boy  who were not identified  also were released at the same time. The girls were released at about 3 a.m. “through back-channel efforts and with the help of some friends of the country ” according to a statement from Lai Mohammed  Nigeria’s information minister. Babale Abubakar  a local government worker  said one released student had told him that five girls  who had been fasting before their abduction and were therefore already in a weakened state and extremely thirsty  had died while being held captive. Other news outlets said five captives had been trampled in overcrowded trucks. One of the released students  Maryam Adamu  said that Leah Sherubu  the Christian girl who was still being held  was in tears as the other girls were being rounded up to be returned. None None Boko Haram  whose name can be loosely translated as “Western education is forbidden ” was founded years ago by adherents who wanted to create an Islamic state  hoping it would put an end to years of corruption and neglect by government officials. None That faction two years ago criticized the kidnapping of any Muslim students who were among those taken from the school in Chibok  said Jacob Zenn  an African affairs fellow at the Jamestown Foundation  a Washington-based research organization. Mr. Zenn said the Islamic State in the past had offered alternatives to killing schoolchildren  condoning the murders of male students only if it was clear that the boys would later join the Nigerian military. “It is possible this attack was genuinely a warning against Western education to the families of Dapchi and northern Nigeria more generally ” Mr. Zenn said. In at least one case  the threat worked. One of the abductees  Hauwa Lawal  14  told her parents that she was not going back to school again  said Abubakar Mohammed  31  who sometimes keeps Hauwa at his house when her parents are out of town. Hauwa told her family that the Boko Haram fighters were good to the girls and fed them rice and corn dishes  gave them water  did not touch them and offered them Islamic training while telling them to avoid Western schooling  according to Mr. Mohammed. They would not let the girls bathe  however. But fighters told the girls to stop listening when people said that the group brainwashed  poisoned or harmed its captives  Mr. Mohammed said. Mr. Mohammed said that parents in other towns had called ahead after Boko Haram dropped off the first three girls at their homes to alert Dapchi residents that militants did not appear to have violent intentions. “Some of us were running towards them  but it felt like suicide to run to Boko Haram ” Mr. Mohammed said. “At the same time  they had our daughters.” The girls told their parents that they had been kept in what seemed to be a forest  the militants told some of the girls they were in nearby Niger  according to several accounts from returned girls. They heard aircraft flying overhead. It took them days to get back to Dapchi  and they crossed desert terrain and bodies of water. Zainab Abubakar  one of the returned students  said that while with Boko Haram the girls were moved from place to place  apparently to avoid detection from security forces. None The government of Nigeria paid millions of dollars in ransoms and released high-level Boko Haram commanders in exchange for the release of students from the school in Chibok. The ransom payments have led critics to express worry that they could inspire more kidnappings. On Wednesday  Reuters reported that some parents of missing Chibok girls were in Dapchi  having traveled there to share their grief over missing daughters. Instead they watched as the parents were reunited with their girls. Dionne Searcey reported from Dakar  Senegal  and Emmanuel Akinwotu from London.

The hostages  which consisted mainly of women and children  were rescued from four villages in the Bama area of Borno State  military spokesman Brig. Gen. Texas Chukwu said. Among the rescued were some men who had been forced to become Boko Haram fighters  he said. Nigeria's military conducted the operation with allies from the Multinational Joint Task Force  according to Chukwu. He wouldn't give details of when the rescues took place or over what period of time. Boko Haram has been responsible for thousands of abductions  especially of young girls and women  during its nine-year insurgency in Nigeria and neighboring countries. Nigeria's army has staged rescues before  but many victims  including some girls abducted from Chibok in 2014  remain missing. In February  the military said it rescued more than 1 100 people held in different parts of the Lake Chad region near Cameroon. About 110 girls were kidnapped on Feb. 19 by Boko Haram from a school in Dapchi town  and most were later released. The Nigerian government denies that it paid a ransom or made a prisoner swap in exchange for the Dapchi girls' freedom. President Muhammadu Buhari  who made the fight against Boko Haram a key issue before his 2015 election win  faces growing pressure ahead of next year's election. His government has repeatedly declared that Boko Haram has been defeated  but the Islamic extremists continue to carry out kidnappings and deadly suicide attacks.

It said the hostages consisted mainly of women and children  as well as some young men who had forced to fight for the group. Reuters was unable to independently verify the details contained in the military statement. The military  in an emailed statement  said troops rescued hostages from Malamkari  Amchaka  Walasa and Gora villages of Bama Local Government Area in the northeastern state of Borno. It said the operation was conducted in conjunction with troops from neighboring countries who make up the Multinational Joint Task Force. The government has been saying since December 2015 that the militants had been defeated. But the group  which has kidnapped thousands since it began an insurgency in 2009 aimed at creating an Islamic state in the northeast  has carried out high-profile attacks in the last few months. President Muhammadu Buhari  who took office in May 2015 vowing to end Boko Haram's insurgency  has made it a priority to improve security in Africa's most populous country but insurgents have continued to carry out suicide bombings  gun raids and kidnappings.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/20/world/africa/nigeria-boko-haram-schoolgirls.html,Nigeria Failed to Act in Schoolgirl Kidnappings by Boko Haram  Report Says Advertisement Supported by None None None Military officials responded in forceful terms to Amnesty’s accusations  with a spokesman suggesting the group was being “economical with the truth” and trying to undermine “our military and our institutions.” In a longer statement issued on Tuesday  the military went further in its criticism of the rights group. “Most of their narratives are outright falsehood and a calculated attempt to whip up sentiments and mislead unsuspecting Nigerians ” the statement said. Boko Haram fighters descended on Dapchi in the evening of Feb. 19  arriving in vehicles that looked similar to those used by the military and wearing fatigues. Confused students  some as young as 11  thought the militants were soldiers trying to help them  and many scrambled to get inside the trucks. Residents reported hearing the captured girls scream as the trucks sped away. Amnesty said police officers in the town had fled because they feared they would be overpowered. The police in Dapchi could not immediately be reached for comment. “The Nigerian authorities must investigate the inexcusable security lapses that allowed this abduction to take place without any tangible attempt to prevent it ” Osai Ojigho  Nigeria director of Amnesty International  said in the news release. “As an even greater priority  the government must use all lawful means at its disposal to ensure that these girls are rescued ” she added. The military spokesman  Gen. John Agim  said the rights group should have reported its concerns to a committee set up to investigate the kidnapping. Six weeks before the attack  the military abandoned a checkpoint at the entrance to Dapchi after soldiers were redeployed to fight Boko Haram near the border with Niger. The town had not had security issues in the months before the attack. General Agim noted that the United States was in the process of selling fighter jets and weapons to help Nigeria fight the war with Boko Haram  and said that Amnesty’s aim was “to see how they can scuttle those efforts and U.S. help to Nigeria.” American military officials have said that Nigerian officials have requested intelligence assistance to find the girls  who are believed to have been kidnapped by a faction of Boko Haram affiliated with the Islamic State. None Amnesty said its researchers had visited Dapchi and interviewed 23 people  including girls who escaped  parents of abducted girls  local officials  witnesses and three security officials. The rights group said it shared its findings with Nigerian officials two weeks ago. On the afternoon of the kidnappings  an initial call was made to the army command in Geidam  about 30 miles from Dapchi  informing soldiers that Boko Haram fighters had been spotted outside Geidam. Calls were later made to the command  with the answering officer responding that the military was aware of the situation  Amnesty said. “However  the evidence documented by Amnesty International shows that the military did nothing to engage with Boko Haram and ensure the protection of civilians ” the report said. Later in the afternoon  Boko Haram fighters arrived in Gumsa  a town close to Dapchi  and stayed there two hours. Residents of Gumsa called friends in Dapchi to warn them that fighters were on the way. “One villager who received such a call said he informed a police sergeant who promised to notify the Dapchi division police officer ” Amnesty said. The group’s researchers learned that police officers had run away because they believed they would be no match for the Boko Haram fighters. Residents said the nearly 50 militants had at least one truck mounted with a high-powered weapon. In Dapchi  residents said militants had passed the police station on their way in and out of town. At least two people said their friends had told them that they had called the police after seeing militants arrive  but that they had received no response. Residents said the police chief was out of town the night of the attack. Babale Abubakar  a government worker in Dapchi  said he thought it unlikely that residents would call the military  “because people do not readily just call them like that  but they will call their police or inform officers that they see in the town or other security agents.” None None “The Nigerian authorities have failed in their duty to protect civilians  just as they did in Chibok four years ago ” the Amnesty news release said. Nigerian officials said on Monday they had deployed at least 2 000 armed police officers to more than 300 schools as part of an effort to bolster security in northeastern Nigeria  where Boko Haram is concentrated.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/world/africa/nigeria-kidnapping-boko-haram-dapchi.html,Boko Haram Storms Girls’ School in Nigeria  Renewing Fears Advertisement Supported by None DAKAR  Senegal — Islamist militants stormed into a girls’ school in northern Nigeria this week  and with many girls still unaccounted for  Nigerians feared their country was experiencing a notorious mass abduction like one that drew worldwide condemnation almost four years ago. None More than 50 students were still missing  according to state government officials. The local police gave conflicting information to reporters  saying about 100 girls were gone. Late Wednesday  local media outlets reported that the girls had been rescued  but that could not be verified. During the attack  groups of students ran into the bush and other villages and some headed for their homes on farms far from Dapchi. A few students and residents have told local reporters that some girls were spotted being hauled away by the militants. Mohammed Bilal  an Islamic studies teacher at the school  said the militants arrived about 5:30 p.m. in the village  which until then had escaped the fighting in Northern Nigeria. “The girls were in dorms and I was in my dorm when we heard gunshots and screaming ” he said. “I didn’t see where they were coming from.” Mr. Bilal said he had counted nine vehicles — two were land cruisers with machine guns on top — filled with fighters in military uniforms. He ran away with several students and colleagues  he said  but 30 minutes later returned to gather other students to help them flee. “We were so afraid  but we didn’t want to leave them ” he said. Government officials in Yobe State  where Dapchi is  said on Wednesday that they had no credible information that the girls had been taken hostage. They were continuing to receive reports that some girls had been found safe  they said in a statement. “His Excellency  Gov. Ibrahim Gaidam  is deeply saddened and outraged by the unfortunate event and has directed that all relevant personnel and agencies work closely with the army and other security organizations ” the statement said. Later in the day  President Muhammadu Buhari released his own statement  saying on Twitter that he had directed the military and the police to mobilize to find the missing girls. He said the defense minister would also lead a delegation to Yobe State on Thursday to “ascertain the situation.” “I share the anguish of all the parents and guardians of the girls that remain unaccounted for ” Mr. Buhari said. “I would like to assure them that we are doing all in our power to ensure the safe return of all the girls.” Mr. Bilal said that he and others were able to help about 300 girls climb over the fence around the school’s perimeter. One teacher’s wife miscarried during the attack  and the teacher broke his leg trying to flee  Mr. Bilal said. Mr. Bilal said parents had been arriving at the school looking for their daughters. “It’s an awful situation ” he said. Adding to the confusion was the difficulty reaching some families to confirm that their daughters had turned up at home  some live in areas with poor phone networks. The school has closed for the week to assess the situation. The statement on Wednesday from the Yobe government  more than two days after the attack  was the first time officials remarked publicly about the incident. The long silence stoked fears  largely because it echoed a similar lack of communication in the days following what turned out to be the abduction of nearly 300 girls from a secondary school in the village of Chibok  in an adjacent state  in April 2014. None Senator Ben Murray-Bruce  in a tweet  said the situation in Dapchi “should be handled better.” “I have a terrible sense of Déjà vu ” he wrote. “We can’t allow this to happen again.” None It took a number of days after the students in Chibok were taken to mount any concerted effort to find them  Ms. Ezekwesili said. The slow response  she said  allowed militants to escape with many young girls. Last year government officials negotiated for the release of about half of the missing students from the Chibok kidnapping. Several others escaped. And this month  officials secured the release of a group of police officers and university professors who were kidnapped by Boko Haram last year. Several high-level Boko Haram commanders were also released last year as part of a prisoner swap in exchange for hostages  and millions of dollars was paid to militants as ransom.

The three aid workers who were killed were all Nigerian  the agency said. Four soldiers and four police officers were also killed in the attack  the agency said  with three other humanitarian workers wounded. The Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres said it had suspended its work in Rann after the attack and had evacuated staff members. None Thursday’s attack in Rann was a further setback for President Muhammadu Buhari  who took office in May 2015 vowing to improve security and who has repeatedly said that the Boko Haram insurgency has been defeated. The government said on Friday that its search for the girls taken in Dapchi  about 250 miles west of Rann  had been extended to neighboring countries. The Boko Haram insurgency has been centered in Borno  where militants have used violent means to pursue the imposition of a strict interpretation of Islam. More than 20 000 people have been killed and two million forced to leave their homes since 2009. Two of the aid workers who died in Rann were contractors with the International Organization for Migration and were working as coordinators at the camp for 55 000 displaced people  the United Nations said. The third was a doctor employed as a consultant for Unicef. “We call on authorities to ensure the perpetrators are brought to justice and account ” Edward Kallon  the United Nations humanitarian coordinator in Nigeria  said in a statement. Attacks on aid workers are rare  but not unheard-of. In December  four people were killed when a World Food Program convoy was ambushed in Borno. Boko Haram held a large swath of territory in northeast Nigeria in late 2014. It was pushed out of most of that land by the Nigerian Army  backed by troops from neighboring countries  in early 2015. Although it has failed to control large areas of land since then  Boko Haram continues to carry out suicide bombings and gun raids in northeast Nigeria  as well as in Cameroon  Chad and Niger.

Thinking they were Nigerian military troops  he rushed toward them. “Have you heard the gunshots?” Ali Gambo  70  the unarmed guard  asked the men inside the truck. “What’s happening?” Three men dressed in army fatigues and turbans jumped down from the vehicles  threw Mr. Gambo to the ground and pointed a gun at his head. “We are Boko Haram ” Mr. Gambo recalled him saying. “We are here for your students.” None The gunmen gathered up 110 girls  some as young as 11  dragged them into their trucks and sped away  leaving girls’ sandals and flip-flops scattered across the schoolyard in their wake. President Muhammadu Buhari has declared Boko Haram  the Islamist extremist group  defeated time and again. But the militants’ attack on the Dapchi school has left anguished parents and community members asking how such a kidnapping could happen again  not even four years after another mass abduction of schoolgirls shocked the world. None None Goodluck Jonathan  who was president at the time of the Chibok kidnapping  was widely criticized for not immediately acting to find the students  and government officials had vowed nothing like that would ever happen again. None Not long ago  it seemed as if the Nigerian military was making progress against the extremists  who want to create a religious state of their own. Soldiers regained territory controlled by Boko Haram and captured or killed fighters whose capabilities became so weak that they could no longer pull off complicated operations. The group splintered amid infighting. None President Buhari  who pledged to crush the militants  visited Dapchi on Wednesday to set up a committee to look into the kidnappings in an attempt to soothe outraged critics who accuse federal officials of being slow to respond. “There will be no rest till the last girl  whether from Chibok and Dapchi  is released ” Mr. Buhari said in a statement. “The girls  like all our citizens  must enjoy unhindered freedom and pursue their legitimate aspirations.” None Gen. Thomas D. Waldhauser  head of the United States Africa Command  told a congressional committee this month that Nigeria had asked for intelligence and other support to help find all the missing girls. He said the Dapchi students were most likely taken by a faction of militants that had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State  and he called Boko Haram “one of the most deplorable organizations on the planet.” In recent months  President Buhari has suffered embarrassing setbacks. None None In Dapchi  parents  teachers  students and residents recalled the night that Boko Haram arrived  the first major security incident there since the war began. Aliyu Musa Mabu  the school’s vice principal  had just finished serving meals to students and was heading to the mosque when he heard the first gunshot. It must be nothing  he said he thought to himself  and settled in to pray. Then he heard another shot. He raced outside and saw two military trucks and a pickup armed with an antiaircraft gun. Men were crammed inside  wearing turbans and military fatigues. They were heading toward the school. By the time Mr. Mabu caught up with them  chaos had unfolded. According to witness accounts  girls were running everywhere  some scaling the fence to get free. Militants pulled some down and told others they were soldiers  guiding the girls into their vehicles saying they would protect them. In the confusion  many of the girls believed them and scrambled over one another to get inside the men’s trucks. Militants who saw one student  Hafsat Lawan  17  and her friends hurrying over the fence beckoned them to come for safety. The girls started toward the fighters but  Ms. Lawan later said  became suspicious of their turbans and sandals and their use of the local language  which is often unfamiliar to soldiers recruited from across the country. She fled. “The sad thing is some of the students ran to them — including my younger sister ” said Ms. Lawan  whose 14-year-old sister is presumed to be among the hostages. Fatima Bukar  14  was in her dorm near to the school fence when she heard gunshots. “We weren’t sure where it was coming from ” she said. “We were confused.” One girl ran toward Fatima and her friends  telling them to flee for their lives because Boko Haram had arrived. Fatima said she saw girls being led outside the school gate and into militants’ trucks  she recognized many friends among them. “They were saying if you run we will shoot you ” she said. “They were shooting into the air.” Fatima bolted over the fence and ran through the bush  thinking that because the area had no road  the militants would be less likely to chase her. She fled with about 30 girls and a teacher who led them to a farm  where the group spent the night  too terrified to fall asleep. At his home not far from the school  Fatima’s father  Auwal Bukar  was panicking. He had crouched in his house when he heard gunshots. He peeked outside later and saw trucks packed with girls. It was dark  but their sobs were unmistakable. “We could hear them crying very clearly ” he said. As the trucks headed outside town  witnesses said  some of the girls appeared to be tied up with their own clothing. They heard the screams as the vehicles sped away. Afterward  an eerie silence fell over the area. Not long after  many of the girls who had been hiding in the bush started to trickle back to the school. But tallying the missing was complicated. Some girls  like Fatima  spent the entire night in the countryside  too terrified to return. Some fled straight to their family farms  far from the reach of cellular networks. Hours after the kidnapping  school officials found girls still hiding in toilets  classrooms and other buildings on the campus. Wakil Zanna  55  a retired civil servant  arrived at the school at 7 the morning after the attack to search for his two missing daughters  Aisha Wakil  13  and Falmata Wakil  14. Other parents were there  too  demanding answers about their daughters’ whereabouts. No one seemed to have any clarity about anything. Federal officials were silent. In the days immediately after the attack  the police denied an abduction had taken place. Then a state official announced that the girls had been rescued. Elated parents rushed to the school as the governor’s convoy rolled into town with vehicles they presumed were carrying their daughters. Instead  the governor announced he had been mistaken  the girls were still missing. He apologized. Parents rioted. Residents have since learned that a military checkpoint at the entrance to town had been dismantled not long before the kidnapping  when soldiers left to pursue Boko Haram near the Nigerien border. Dapchi employs a police force  but on the night of the attack  the commander was out of town. “They came and did their operation uninterrupted and left ” said Hadiza Jibo  the school matron. “This is something that would have been averted if military presence was visible in the town. It’s really traumatic  honestly.” The military and the president have sought to reassure Nigerians that they are looking for the girls. But Mr. Buhari recently angered residents by traveling to a lavish wedding before heading to Dapchi to sympathize with the missing girls’ families. Alhaji Baba Shehu  who has several nieces and other relatives attending the school  said he feared many parents in a region where education for girls is already lagging would now be reluctant to send their daughters to school. His relatives managed to escape the Boko Haram attack  but he has a friend who had enrolled his daughter at the Dapchi school for the first time  on the very day militants attacked. The child was kidnapped. Even the girls who escaped are traumatized  he said  and some are afraid to return to school. Several public figures in Nigeria have said the kidnapping reflects poorly on the government. “We are spending billions trying to encourage girls to go to school  only to allow them be abducted by terrorists ” said Atiku Abubakar  a former vice president who is likely to run for president in 2019. “I condemn these abductions  and I urge the federal government to take firm action to ensure that it would never reoccur in Nigeria.” As the election approaches  calls are growing from both the president’s critics and one-time supporters for him not to seek a second term in office. Some rivals are using the Dapchi kidnapping to build their case  and a fringe element has even accused the president of orchestrating the kidnappings so that he could emerge heroic by negotiating the girls’ release. Bashir Manzo’s daughter  Aisha  is among the missing students. He has joined an association of parents who are pushing the government not to give up looking. Some of them rallied over the weekend in the nation’s capital  Abuja. Mr. Manzo said he could not stop thinking about his daughter in the hands of militants. He would rather she be dead. “It’s far better for me because the corpse would have long been claimed and buried by now ” Mr. Manzo said. “But for my daughter to be alive under forceful restriction in the name of abduction and with nothing being done tangibly to rescue her is enough trauma for me.” Jonathan Gopep reported from Dapchi  Nigeria  Dionne Searcey from Dakar  Senegal  and Emmanuel Akinwotu from London.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/magazine/the-quiet-americans-behind-the-us-russia-imbroglio.html,The Quiet Americans Behind the U.S.-Russia Imbroglio Can Washington’s “Russia hands” help explain why the post-Cold War relationship has gone off the rails? None None This strange story included an intriguing detour into the recent history of United States foreign policy. One of Rybka’s initial posts on the Deripaska affair was a short audio clip from a conversation that took place on the oligarch’s yacht in August 2016. As they sailed off the coast of Norway  Rybka and Deripaska were joined by an influential Kremlin official named Sergei Eduardovich Prikhodko  and in the clip  Deripaska  who made his fortune during the violent aluminum wars of the 1990s  explains some things about geopolitics to Rybka  who was 26 at the time. “Our relations with America are bad ” Deripaska says. “Why? Because the person in charge of them is Sergei Eduardovich’s ‘friend’ — Nuland is what she is called. When she was young — about your age — she spent a month living on a Soviet whaling vessel. Ever since then  she’s hated our country.” Deripaska was referring to Victoria Nuland  a longtime American government official and “Russia hand ” as Russia experts are sometimes known  who at the time of the video was assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasia. Nuland had in fact  as Deripaska said  spent time aboard a Soviet vessel (fishing  not whaling) in the mid-1980s  whether she hated Russia ever after is a subject of some dispute. She spent three decades in various posts in the State Department and the White House. In 2013  as a newly confirmed assistant secretary of state  she became the point person for the increasingly fraught situation in Ukraine  where large protests against the president  following his decision to pull out of an economic agreement with the European Union  eventually led to his ouster. Early in the protests  Nuland was filmed handing out sandwiches  pastries and cookies to the demonstrators in what some viewed as a provocative show of solidarity. Later  as the government began to totter  she made a call that was intercepted and leaked online  most likely by Russian intelligence  in which she discarded the notion of working with the E.U. to resolve the crisis. “[Expletive] the E.U. ” she memorably said. What was remarkable about the episode was the utter confidence with which Nuland seemed to speak for the United States and its policy. From the start of his administration  President Barack Obama had tried to lower tensions with Russia and refocus American attention on a rising China  he had made clear he wanted no part in the problems of the post-Soviet periphery. Yet in the middle of the uprising in Kiev  there was Nuland  encouraging protesters and insulting European allies. And after the call leaked  it was Nuland  as much as Obama  who came to personify American policy for everyday Russians — to the point that a professional sex coach like Rybka knows more about her biography than all but a handful of Americans. Advertisement During two decades  on and off  reporting in Russia and the post-Soviet states — in the turbulent ’90s  the wealthy but depressing aughts and finally during the eruption of violence in Ukraine — I occasionally heard people talk about how “the Americans” wanted this or that political outcome. The events in Ukraine demonstrated  or seemed to demonstrate  that behind the visible facade of changing presidents and changing policy statements and changing styles  “the Americans” were actually a small core of officials who not only executed policy but also effectively determined it. The continuing wars in Ukraine and Syria  the apparent Russian campaign of targeted assassinations on foreign soil  the widening gyre of sanctions and countersanctions and the still-festering question of Russian meddling in the 2016 election have made for the worst relations between the two countries since the 1980s. Understanding how to get out of this mess will require understanding how we got into it. There may be no better place to start than with the people inside the American government who have been working on the subject since 1991 — the Russia hands. None Some Russia observers argue that this pattern of failure is a result of Russian intransigence and revisionism. But others believe that the intransigent and unchanging one in the relationship is the United States — that the country has never gotten past the idea that it “won” the Cold War and therefore needs to spread  at all costs  the American way of life. Advertisement Last summer  a few months after the inauguration of President Trump  I began traveling to Washington to speak with Russia hands: those who had worked on Russia inside the State Department  the National Security Council or the Department of Defense. I interviewed hands who served in the government as far back as Jimmy Carter and up to the current administration  some served Republican presidents  others served Democrats  but a vast majority served both parties. The government  as a rule  discourages specialization: Military officers and diplomats are constantly transferred from one post to another  from one region to the next. Still  specialists do emerge. Many but not all Russia hands have Ph.D.’s — in Russian history or political science or security studies. Others got their graduate education on the job. Nuland worked on the Soviet fishing trawler  Daniel Fried  her eventual close collaborator at the State Department  spent a semester as a live-in babysitter for an American Embassy family in Moscow. “Seeing Communism up close cures you of all your left-liberal illusions that the Cold War is a misunderstanding that can be cured through arms control and détente ” Fried says. “Communism up close is very ugly.” Some Russia hands started out as civil servants or military officers  others as academics pulled into government service after working as advisers on political campaigns. The Russia hands have clear generational characteristics. Those who came of age at the height of the Cold War worked on Russia because it was America’s most important foreign-policy problem. Many of those who finished graduate school or officer-training school in the late ’80s or early ’90s bear the scars of having studied a subject that became seemingly irrelevant overnight. In 1989  Peter Zwack  now a retired brigadier general  was a young military-intelligence officer stationed in Germany  taking Russian language and politics courses. “I was waiting for them to come through the Fulda Gap ” he says  referring to a section of West Germany through which NATO planners expected the Soviets to push large mechanized formations. “We were outmanned. I thought we were outgunned.” But the Soviets never came  and for the next 20 years Zwack worked in the Balkans  then Afghanistan and South Korea  before finally returning to Russia in 2012 as defense attaché to the American Embassy. With the collapse of the Soviet Union  the United States had to staff 14 new embassies in the post-Soviet republics. Many of the Foreign Service officers who emerged from these postings did so with a somewhat jaundiced view of Russia. “When you start looking at the Russians by the people who have been visited by the Russians ” says Fried  who spent a fair amount of time in Poland during his long career in the Foreign Service  “you tend to see it a different way.” Finally  there is the younger generation  those 40 and under. These Russia hands are for the moment a rarer species. “If you were an ambitious young Foreign Service officer after 9/11  you wanted to get sent to some reconstruction team in Afghanistan or Iraq ” says Andrew Weiss  who worked on Russia at the National Security Council during the Clinton administration and now runs the Russia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “You wanted to learn Arabic. If you were ambitious  you did not want to go to the embassy in Ukraine.” As in other foreign-policy sectors  the Russia hands divide less along party lines than along foreign-policy philosophies: They are either “realists” or “internationalists.” Realists tend to be cautious about American overseas commitments and deferential toward state sovereignty  internationalists tend to be more inclined to universalist ideals like democracy and human rights  even where these are forced to cross borders. But the two supposed categories are blurred by a thousand factors  not least of which being that realists don’t like being called realists  because it suggests that they have no values  and internationalists don’t like to be called internationalists  as opposed to realists  because it suggests that they have no common sense. In the end  a vast internationalist middle  consisting of neoconservative Republicans and interventionist Democrats  predominates  with tiny slices of hard realists on the right and soft realists  or “neorealists ” on the left. And there are many shades of difference among all these people. The longtime Russia hand Stephen Sestanovich  a veteran of the Reagan and Clinton administrations  says there are two kinds of Russia hands — those who came to Russia through political science and those who came to it through literature. The literature hands  he suggests  sometimes let their emotions get the best of them  while the political-science hands  like Sestanovich  are more cool and collected. Fried  who served in every administration from Carter to Obama  also thinks there are two kinds of Russia hands  though he draws a different dividing line: There are those  like himself  who “put Russia in context  held up against the light of outside standards and consequences.” These people tend to be tough on Russia. And then there are those “who take Russia on its own terms  attractive and wonderful but subject to romanticization.” These people tend to give Russia what Fried would consider a pass. Then there are those  like Michael Kofman  a young Kiev-born military analyst at the Center for Naval Analyses in Arlington  Va.  who say that there only appear to be two kinds of Russia hands. “There are the nice missionaries who knock on your door and say  ‘Hey  have you heard the good news about democracy  freedom and liberalism?’ And then there are the crusaders who are trying to claim the heathen Eastern European lands for democracy and freedom. But they’re basically the same person  they’re two sides of the same coin.” Advertisement There are two kinds of Russia hands  or maybe there are six kinds of Russia hands  or maybe there is an infinite variety of Russia hands. And yet the mystery is this: After all the many different Russia hands who have served in the United States government  the country’s relations with Russia are as they have always been — bad. None The first high-level Russia hand of the post-Cold War era was a man named Nelson Strobridge Talbott III  or Strobe for short. The scion of a prosperous Ohio family (his grandfather  the first Nelson Strobridge Talbott  was captain of the Yale football team in 1914)  Talbott followed his forefathers to Yale  where he studied Russian literature and won a Rhodes scholarship to Oxford. There he found himself rooming with a wonky  gregarious Georgetown graduate named Bill Clinton. Talbott remained interested in Russia  writing his master’s thesis on Mayakovsky  translating Nikita Khrushchev’s memoirs and then becoming a foreign correspondent — and eventually a columnist — for Time magazine. He was the first journalist to track down and interview Joseph Brodsky upon his exile to the West in 1972. “Looks like we lucked out ” Brodsky wrote in his diary. “He’s read me.” Talbott’s fundamental view of the U.S.S.R. was that it could be reasoned with  in the pages of Time  he regularly praised the virtues of arms control and détente  and was despised for it by more ardent Cold Warriors. When Clinton was elected president  Talbott came on to advise his old roommate on what Clinton believed to be his most pressing foreign-policy concern: the transformation of Russia into a viable  American-friendly democracy on the eastern edge of Europe. Things did not turn out that way  and most of the reasons were internal to Russia. But the United States was not without its share of blame. The economic advice dispensed by the gurus of what was known as the Washington Consensus weakened an already vulnerable Russian state. Average Russian citizens saw their living standards and life expectancies drop. It was Talbott who offered one of the pithier critiques of the doctrine known as “shock therapy”: What the Russian people wanted  Talbott said  “was less shock and more therapy.” The remark led to one of the stormiest passages of his political career. But he weathered it. During his tenure  the United States made one of the most momentous foreign-policy choices of the post-1991 era: the decision to expand NATO eastward  first into the former countries of the Warsaw Pact  then into the former republics of the Soviet Union itself. Talbott at first was opposed  or at least  as he now puts it  “deeply riven.” On one hand  the Eastern European countries  some of which were now led by heroic former dissidents  wanted very much to join the military alliance  on the other  the Russians warned Talbott — “with a mirthless smile ” as he later recalled — that NATO was to them a “four-letter word.” If the Cold War was really over  as the Americans kept saying it was  why expand a Cold War military alliance set up expressly to deter and contain the Soviet Union? But as much as Talbott loved Russia  there were clear advantages to securing the West’s gains. “If the leadership of a country has any view but the following ” Talbott told me last summer  “it’s not going to be the leadership of that county for very long. And that is: We do what we can in our own interest.” But the NATO question  Talbott admitted  was complicated. “Should we have had a higher  wiser concept of our real interests that would require us to hold back on what many people would say is our own current interest?” At the time the debate was taking place — 1993 and 1994 — much of the State Department and the Pentagon took the anti-expansion view  arguing that it would needlessly antagonize Russia at a difficult moment in its post-Communist journey and that the alliance was unwieldy enough without incorporating three fledgling Eastern European democracies (not to mention  eventually  Romania). But there were some who disagreed. A small working group at RAND produced a report arguing for NATO expansion as key to the future of Eastern Europe. “We talked to the Poles  and they said: ‘If you don’t let us into NATO  we’re getting nuclear weapons. We don’t trust the Russians ’ ” one of the report’s authors  a former Air Force officer and Pentagon strategist named Richard L. Kugler  told me. “Then we talked to the Germans. They said: ‘The line of contact with the Russians now runs through Warsaw. If you don’t defend it  we will.’ We had a vision of a nuclear-armed Poland being fortified by German troops facing off with the Russians — I don’t think anyone wanted that!” The report was laughed at and rejected in some quarters — a State Department official supposedly threw it in the trash in front of one of its authors — but Fried  then at the National Security Council  started using it to lobby inside the administration for a more robust approach to expansion. Talbott initially resisted  but he and Clinton soon came around. The decision on NATO was essentially made by early 1994  but it would take some years before the first countries joined the alliance  and in the meantime  relations between Russia and the United States steadily declined: Russia was angered by the NATO bombing of Bosnian Serb positions in 1995  by the American insistence that the Russians stop the sale of nuclear technology to Iran and especially by the 1999 NATO bombing — just a few weeks after the Czech Republic  Hungary and Poland finally joined the alliance — of Belgrade. That conflict almost expanded when a small contingent of Russian troops seized the Pristina airport in Kosovo. If a British officer named James Blunt had not refused to act on an order from Gen. Wesley Clark to clear the airport  things might have turned out a lot worse. Blunt went on to fame as a rock musician with the hit song “You’re Beautiful ” but the Russia-United States relationship remained precarious. The damage  in any case  was done. “We were so excited about the spread of democracy and the collapse of Communism ” says Olga Oliker  director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “There were all these countries saying  ‘Yes  please  take us into NATO with weapons that you’ll give us to defend ourselves from the Russians  who are going to be coming like they always do.’ And we said  ‘Well  the Russians aren’t coming  but yes  please  join us in democracy.’ Advertisement “But the Russians took it as a sign that we were still against them. It was really hard to walk back from. From there on out  we were doing things that we kept saying  ‘We’re not doing this to hurt you ’ and that the Russians felt hurt them. We didn’t do it because we wanted to hurt them. We did it because we didn’t care if it hurt them.” None Factors external to Russia played a role here: The Sept. 11 attacks refocused American foreign policy around counterterrorism. “We had a long period of inattention because of the war on terror ” Weiss says. “It was a long period where anyone who banged his fist on the table and said: ‘Mr. President! Mr. President! Drop everything you’re doing killing bin Laden’s inner circle! We need to talk to you because Vladimir Putin is mad about blah blah blah!’ You can imagine how that did not rate.” But it wasn’t just the fight against terrorism. The Soviet Union’s collapse and Russia’s subsequent weakness reconfigured the entire process of American decision-making. When I asked Graham about the decline in relations on his watch  he delivered a soliloquy about bureaucracy. “The way the N.S.C. is structured ” he began  “the way the State Department is structured  is through a series of regional and functional bureaus. The question is always  Who takes the lead?” In Soviet times  when the entire foreign policy of the United States was oriented around countering the Soviet threat  the Russia hands frequently took the lead. In the post-Soviet era  with an increasingly irrelevant Russia  the reverse was true. “Russia was unique in that it’s a country that was a factor in almost all the major things the U.S. government did  but it wasn’t in any place the most important factor. So you’re working on missile defense: Russia is clearly an important player in missile defense. But that process is not led by the person who’s responsible for Russia policy  it’s led by the person who’s responsible for nonproliferation policy. If you come to energy  Russia is obviously an important player in global energy markets  but Russia is not the most important player in global energy markets. That’s the Saudis and OPEC. So when you come to an energy issue  the people who are in charge of energy run that.” The same was true of the states of the former Soviet Union  which were now independent and the province of different regional desks at the State Department and the N.S.C. The most damaging episode in United States-Russia relations during Graham’s time at the N.S.C. was American cheerleading for the Orange Revolution in Ukraine in late 2004 and early 2005. Graham argued that the Russians saw the “color revolutions ” as the Rose and Orange Revolutions were known  as an outgrowth of American policy and feared that regime change would be coming to Russia next. But freedom was on the march  Graham was told: “ ‘All we’re doing is promoting democracy.’ ” “But you’re the Russia expert ” I said. “But Ukraine is not a Russia issue ” he said. “It’s a Ukrainian issue. There’s a bureau for European affairs that overseas Ukrainian issues.” During the Orange Revolution  the Europe desk at the N.S.C. was run by Fried. “My main contribution ” Graham summed up  “was preventing things from being worse than they could have been.” Graham left government in 2007. Fried  his sometime nemesis  had become assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasia and continued to push vocal American support of Western-leaning governments in former Soviet states  Georgia in particular. Nuland was the American ambassador to NATO. In April 2008  at a NATO summit meeting in Bucharest  the alliance announced over strong Russian objections that it intended to eventually admit Georgia and Ukraine. Four months later  deteriorating security conditions in South Ossetia  Georgia  provoked an emboldened Saakashvili into an attack on the breakaway region. Russian forces intervened  crushing the Georgian Army in less than a week. Advertisement None The next president  Barack Obama  was the rare American politician with a sense of the fallibility of American power. He opposed the Iraq war and spoke honestly about the crimes of the American empire. Yet he was also divided in his mind. A realist in most of his foreign-policy leanings  Obama chose as his chief Russia hand a Stanford political-science professor named Michael McFaul. McFaul had spent years visiting Russia and writing about it. He was a Russophile  an advocate of more cooperative relations and a critic of the Bush administration’s unilateralism: in all this  a good fit for Obama. But he was also an avid internationalist and democracy promoter  who had speculated in a widely circulated 2005 essay on the seven “factors for success” required for color revolution — the implication being that more such revolutions were necessary and desirable. In 2008  McFaul proposed a “reset” in relations between the two countries. This became the administration’s policy  and for a while it worked. A new arms-control agreement was negotiated. Dmitri Medvedev  who succeeded Putin as president in early 2008  toured Silicon Valley. Russia joined the World Trade Organization. And a sprawling supply chain  called the Northern Distribution Network  was established to move supplies through Russia to NATO troops in Afghanistan. The existence of an alternate route gave the United States some leeway in its dealings with Pakistan. When Pakistan cut off the supply route in Afghanistan not long after the assassination of Osama bin Laden  NATO simply sent more through Russia. But relations with Russia soon soured. The more liberal Medvedev years created an expectation on the part of some Russians that the country would open up  when Medvedev announced in 2011 that he was stepping aside  that Putin would be returning to the presidency and that this is what they had planned all along  there was a feeling of grievous disappointment. Three months later  spurred by a number of blatant falsifications in the national Duma elections  this disappointment erupted into the largest protests of the post-Soviet period. Hillary Clinton  then the secretary of state  voiced approval for the protests and expressed “serious concerns” about the voting irregularities. Her comments fed the Kremlin’s fears that the United States was somehow behind the demonstrations. McFaul  who arrived as ambassador to Russia in the midst of the protest wave  inflamed the situation further by taking a meeting with opposition leaders. He was never forgiven by the Russian authorities  who proceeded to harass him and his family and denounce him whenever possible as a foreign spy.

From there  the relationship grew increasingly strained. In the words of Paul Stronski  a Russia hand who joined the N.S.C. in 2012: “I was brought in to do reset  Part 2. Instead  I got Magnitsky  Snowden and Ukraine.” Magnitsky was the Magnitsky Act  which imposes sanctions on individuals engaged in human rights violations and corruption and was inspired by the death in prison of a Russian tax attorney  Sergei Magnitsky  who was arrested after uncovering a huge corruption scheme. Snowden was Edward Snowden  who turned up in Moscow after orchestrating perhaps the most significant leak of American government documents since the Pentagon Papers. And Ukraine was  of course  Ukraine. Ukraine was a catastrophe two decades in the making. Its government was as corrupt and ineffectual as any in the post-Soviet space  it produced neither oil nor gas to serve as a financial cushion  and it was divided between a Russian-leaning east and a Europe-leaning west. To make matters worse  it was also the host  at Sevastopol  of the Russian Black Sea fleet  whose long-term lease  during times of tension  tended to become a political football. In the summer of 2013  with the shock of Snowden’s turning up in Moscow still fresh  Russian officials started making noise about an “association agreement” that Ukraine was about to sign with the European Union. To the Russians  the proposed agreement was a rejection of their own cherished customs’ union  the Eurasian Economic Union  as well as a concrete step toward European integration for a country with which it had profound  centuries-old connections. And European integration  the Russians believed  would eventually mean NATO membership: hostile troops on the Russian border and an end to the lease for the Russian fleet. McFaul  still in Moscow  was one of the people to whom the Russians took these complaints. By his own account  he was dismissive of their concerns. First of all  he said  it wasn’t Russia’s business what Ukraine signed or didn’t sign. And second  he didn’t think the Russians should get all worked up. “We’re talking about an association agreement ” he told me. “That’s expansion of the E.U. maybe in the year 2040  2050? Ask the Turks about their association agreement.” (Turkey signed a similar agreement with the E.U. in 1963 and still has not become a member.) It was just a piece of paper. But the Russians didn’t seem to think so. And neither  it would turn out  did the Ukrainians. When Viktor Yanukovych  the president of Ukraine  under intense Russian pressure  pulled out of the accord with the Europeans  people took to the streets. Advertisement None The daughter of Sherwin Nuland  the surgeon and Yale bioethicist  she fell in love with Russian culture after seeing a performance of Chekhov’s “Three Sisters” when she was 12  she studied Russian history and politics at Brown  worked at a Soviet children’s camp and after that for an embassy family in Moscow. Then  eager for adventure and contact with real-live Russians  she did her tour on the Soviet fishing vessel (for seven months  not one). That experience taught her something about the planned economy: After 25 days of drinking and card-playing  the crew did five days of hard work to meet their monthly targets. She also says she learned “how to drink 10 shots of vodka and still get back to my cabin and put a chair under the doorknob. Things could get a little hairy when the boys were drunk.” She entered the Foreign Service in 1984. Over a long and eventful career  she witnessed the defense of the Russian White House during the attempted hard-line coup against Mikhail Gorbachev  served as Talbott’s chief of staff during the chaotic ’90s  worked as Dick Cheney’s deputy national security adviser in the years after Sept. 11 but “before Cheney became Cheney ” as she put it  and served as the State Department spokeswoman under Hillary Clinton. She was known inside successive administrations as a Russia hawk  but when asked if she hated the country  she drew a distinction between “Russian culture and the Russian people ” which she loves  and the Soviet strain she sees in Putin’s Russia  which she does not. “I deplore the way successive governments in Moscow — Soviet and Russian — have abused their own people  ripped them off  constrained their choices and made us the enemy to mask their own failings ” Nuland says. Hearing her speak with such conviction about governments that  in at least one case  no longer existed  you could understand how she had been over the years a very effective advocate inside several American administrations for her point of view. In December 2013  with the protests in the center of Kiev just a few weeks old  Nuland traveled to Moscow and then to Kiev to try to defuse the crisis that had engulfed the Yanukovych government. She made little progress with the Kremlin  which was of the opinion that Yanukovych should simply clear the protesters from the streets. On her first night in Kiev  she was woken by members of her staff. The riot police brought out to contain the protests had formed a ring around them and were closing in. The demonstrators were desperately singing patriotic songs to keep up their spirits  but they were in mortal danger. Nuland got on the phone with Washington and worked to release a statement in Secretary of State John Kerry’s name  expressing “disgust” at the move on peaceful protesters. “After that ” Nuland says  “the singing grew louder”  the demonstrators on the square  she told me  were holding their phones in the air  “displaying the Kerry statement in Ukrainian and Russian.” The riot troops backed off. The next morning  Nuland was to meet with Yanukovych. But first she wanted to visit the protest encampment  which  two weeks into its existence  had grown in both scope and moral authority. “In accordance with Slavic tradition  I wanted to bring something ” Nuland says. She took a large plastic bag filled with treats. Alongside Pyatt  she handed them out to the protesters  and thus was born one of the iconic images of the Ukraine crisis  immediately and widely circulated by the Kremlin’s media apparatuses — a powerful official  not a famous politician like Senator John McCain or Secretary of State John Kerry but a representative of the supposedly more neutral American policymaking bureaucracy  succoring revolutionaries in the center of Kiev. (Nuland points out that they also gave food to the riot police.) Two months later  as the Yanukovych government entered its terminal phase  Nuland’s “[Expletive] the E.U.” comment leaked out. For many Russians and Europeans  the line became emblematic of American arrogance. A few weeks later  Yanukovych fled the country  and Russian troops annexed Crimea. In tandem with Fried  who had taken the newly established position of sanctions coordinator at the State Department  Nuland began drafting harsh sanctions against Putin’s inner circle  individuals involved in the invasion of Ukraine and eventually large Russian companies and banks. Fried told me that one senior State Department official thought this was pretty funny. He said to Fried  “Do the Russians realize that the two hardest-line people in the entire U.S. government are now in a position to go after them?” The Russians may have realized this perfectly well. According to American intelligence agencies  two years after the sanctions went into effect  the Russians started feeding emails stolen from the servers of the Democratic National Committee to WikiLeaks and helping with their distribution. None Advertisement Kimmage nonetheless found the experience enlightening  and he came away with the feeling that a lot of what the American government did had deep and sometimes invisible ideological sources. The apparent final triumph of liberal democracy in Europe in 1989 produced two powerful strains in American internationalist foreign-policy thinking  according to Kimmage — one radical  the other moderate. The radical strain  associated with the neocons  called for a universal democratization  by force if need be. This strain was (mostly) discredited in Iraq. But the other strain  which aimed to spread American-style democracy as far east as possible into Eurasia  has never been discredited. It is close to being the conventional wisdom in Washington  and it is carried forth  Kimmage suggests  by a certain sort of young person  typically a graduate of Yale or Georgetown  “who believes — perhaps by definition — in the virtues of American power.” And yet there is  within the Russia-hand community  a small countervailing tendency. This new generation of Russia hands is deeply skeptical of the missionary impulse that has characterized American policy toward Russia for so long. Oliker is one  Kimmage another. There is also the military analyst Michael Kofman  at the Center for Naval Analyses  and Samuel Charap  at RAND  whose recent book on the events leading to the war in Ukraine  “Everyone Loses ” written with the Harvard political scientist Timothy Colton  lays out week by week the way in which American  European and Russian policy in 2012 and 2013 pushed Ukraine into a zero-sum choice  leading eventually to the collapse of the government and the dismemberment of the country. And there are others  some who prefer not to be named. Despite some differences in politics  all are seeking a less chauvinistic approach to Russia policy. They are disgusted by American failures and want them to end. “I find the past 17 years of continuous warfare to be abnormal and abhorrent ” one of them wrote in an email. “It’s a real reflection on our policy community that they have placed their nation in this position.” In the harsh climate of Washington opinion  where an errant editorial could come back in the form of an angry senator reading it aloud at your confirmation hearing  they do what they can to push back. As a group  they have opposed sending weapons to Ukraine as an unnecessary escalation of the proxy war there — “We just lost a proxy war in Syria!” Kofman cried. “Why do we expect to do better in Ukraine?” — and are concerned about the current hype over a potential Russian incursion into the Baltics. Kofman compared American worries about a Russian invasion of the Baltics to equally far-fetched Russian worries about an American move into Belarus. “I don’t know about you ” he said  “but I’ve never heard anyone in Washington say: ‘Wow  Belarus. That’s real prime real estate. We should get that.’ By the same token  the Russians are amazed that we think they want to take the Baltics. They just find it incredible. They’re going to go into the Baltics — which they have no use for — and take on the world’s pre-eminent military alliance? It’s crazy.” None Kofman believes that some form of conventional deterrence on NATO’s eastern flank is useful  but he worries that it can turn into what international relations theorists call a “security dilemma ” wherein the actions you take to increase your security cause your adversary to feel threatened  so that it takes steps to increase its security  forcing you in turn to take further steps to increase yours  and so on  until war. “You have to be very careful where you put forces ” Kofman said. “You can’t start stacking units 20 minutes from St. Petersburg. Keep in mind Russia is the world’s pre-eminent Eurasian land power. They can put more ground forces in Russia  because that’s where they happen to live  than you can put in the Baltics  because that’s not where you live. That’s not a tough competition.” These young Russia hands find the current political and news attention to Russia deeply frustrating  even as its sources are no mystery to them. “I’m a Democrat ” said one Russia hand who spoke on the condition of anonymity so that he could comment openly. “And Russia contributed to the defeat of Secretary Clinton and  frankly  to our current national tragedy. It’s hard for me not to think about that. “But the Democrats see this as a political opening. And the conversation has moved into politics. They don’t want to know what’s actually happening or what we should actually do. They want to beat Trump with this Russia thing.” Advertisement Oliker  of the Center for Strategic and International Studies  makes a similar point: “It used to be you could explain things to people at great length and with nuance  and they would say: ‘Oh  how interesting. You’ve explained it so well  and now I understand better where the Russians are coming from.’ Of course ” she added  “they wouldn’t do any of it  because Russia was secondary or tertiary  and no one cared about Russia. “Now everyone cares about Russia  and there’s no nuance.” Charap  at RAND  says that the postelection political climate has made it impossible to work with Russia even on issues that would benefit both sides. “When the U.S. and Russia work together  they can accomplish things no two other countries can. The only reason we were able to kill bin Laden is that the Northern Distribution Network was set up! McFaul did that. And he had to deal with a lot of people saying: ‘Why are we talking to these people? They’re never going to stick to their agreements.’ “Even I was told once: ‘We don’t want to be chasing Russia.’ What is this  dating?” The difference between these Russia hands and most others is less their analysis of Russia than their analysis of America. According to Oliker  what the United States should be focusing on is “managing hegemonic decline.” America’s vast overseas commitments need to be scaled down bit by bit  in a slow and responsible process. The amount of money spent on the United States military should be brought in line with historical norms and recalibrated to the country’s actual defense needs. Diplomacy (cheap  effective)  rather than military might (expensive  deadly  counterproductive)  needs to become America’s primary means of interacting with the world. So far  Oliker points out  the Trump administration is largely doing the opposite. As for Russia  it’s a threat that needs to be handled  not exaggerated. “We have to talk to them ” Oliker says. “If we don’t talk to them  things are going to get a lot worse. Yes  they hacked our election. Did they invade Ukraine? Yup  they did that. But we talk to countries that do bad things all the time. We have to talk to them  and as we’re talking to them  we have to understand that they don’t think they’re evil. I was testifying on the Hill not long ago  and I was saying  ‘The Russians think they’re acting defensively.’ And the senators were like  ‘But we’ve explained to them over and over that we’re not a threat.’ Like  are you serious?” Zwack  the retired brigadier general who once waited for the Soviets to break through the Fulda Gap and now teaches at the National Defense University  agrees. “Short of a shooting war  you have to find bridges ” he says. “Some people say  ‘It’s not business as usual with the Russians.’ But it’s never business as usual with the Russians! They’re the one nation on the planet that  on a bad day — they’ll go away  too — but they can take us off that planet. “The crisis might not happen in the Baltics or over Syria. It could happen in the Sea of Okhotsk. You’ve got all kinds of Russian military stuff out there  we’ve got military stuff  the Japanese have stuff. It takes one incident — an accident that  to someone threat-inclined  looks like a deliberate action. If those commanders can’t get on the phone or on email to say  ‘This is what it is ’ if the crisis has to now be resolved in Washington or Moscow  it may be too late.” Charap  at RAND  puts it most succinctly: “The threshold for bad stuff happening in the Russia-U.S. relationship is pretty high. Like  nuclear Armageddon. That’s low probability ” he says. “But high impact.” None Advertisement For the past year  the administration’s top Russia hand has been a British-born  Harvard-educated historian and policy analyst named Fiona Hill. A longtime fellow at the Brookings Institution  of which Strobe Talbott became president after the end of the Clinton administration  Hill is the author of “Mr. Putin ” a probing and not entirely unsympathetic biography of the Russian president. In that book  Hill and her co-author  Clifford Gaddy  advocate what another historian has called “strategic empathy ” trying to see the situation from the perspective of your adversary — in this case  Putin. This is the sort of move that more hawkish Russia hands like Fried have long counseled against. But it is unclear how much influence Hill has had on current policy. One report in The Washington Post indicated that the president at one point mistook her for administrative staff and yelled at her  another report in the same paper described her as heading up the recent American expulsion of Russian diplomatic personnel in response to the nerve-agent poisoning of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in England. There isn’t  in any case  much room to maneuver. Fried reached retirement age and left the State Department a few weeks into the Trump administration  Nuland  not yet of retirement age  stepped down the day before Trump’s inauguration. “To show up for work on Inauguration Day and have to do a 180 on U.S. policy toward NATO  Russia  Germany  Brexit — I just couldn’t do it ” she said. But their legacy lives on. Over the summer  and partly in response to the investigation of the Trump campaign’s possible collusion with Russia  Congress voted overwhelmingly to strip the president of his authority to release Russia from Fried’s and Nuland’s sanctions. Only Congress can now end the sanctions. In the words of one Russia hand  the congressional bill makes the United States-Russia confrontation “structural.” “The president is like a captain holding a wheel that isn’t attached to anything ” said the Russia hand. In early March  I met to talk about Russia policy with a senior official in the current administration  who was not authorized to speak to the press and thus asked not to be identified. Nastya Rybka  the Instagramming Belarusian escort  had just been arrested in Thailand  but to my chagrin the official hadn’t even heard of her  instead  the official was focused on a speech Putin had just delivered in which he announced that Russia had supermissiles that could elude American defenses. “He is putting us on notice that we are not listening to him ” the official said of Putin and cautioned that we were at an inflection point in American relations with Russia. “We can’t just have half-cocked sanctions legislation. We can’t go around sanctioning everybody without thinking through the implications. “We’re in a period where the Russians’ threat perception is causing them to think that they need to take pre-emptive  preventive  very aggressive action to get us to back off  or to make us incapable of having a concerted effort to be able to push back ” the official went on. “And if we don’t get our act together and try to tackle that  we’re not going to be able to change the trajectory of our relationship.” The word “trajectory” had a particularly resonant ring in the wake of Putin’s missile video. Our time was over  and I walked back out onto the streets of the capital. A strong nor’easter had knocked out power and grounded flights all along the Eastern Seaboard. Schools  many businesses and parts of the federal government were shut down  the capital looked deserted. I wasn’t sure what to make of my meeting with the administration official. That the official was deeply knowledgeable and highly competent was without any doubt. But it was hard not to feel that in terms of the United States-Russia relationship  it was too little  too late. The official stressed to me that the decision to join the administration came out of wanting to head off a crisis: “When your house is on fire  you go put it out.” But this was now a fire that was going to burn for a very long time. In the Russia-hands community  some who had once been doves had become hawks  and those who had been hawks all along felt vindicated. The small contingent of dissidents was keeping a low profile. I asked one of them if he felt lonely. “I do feel lonely ” he said. “But I am not alone. It’s just that we have to speak more quietly.” One of the first Russia hands trained by the United States government back in the 1920s was George Kennan. The government paid for his Russian lessons in Berlin  then posted him to Riga  the capital of newly independent Latvia  where he mixed with Russian émigrés and studied economic reports from the Soviet Union. When diplomatic relations were finally established between the United States and the U.S.S.R. in the 1930s  he helped set up the embassy in Moscow  and in the postwar era he was among the first to articulate clearly the nature of the Soviet threat. But he was also concerned that his home country not freak out. “Much depends ” he cautioned in his famous “long telegram” from 1946  “on health and vigor of our own society.” None Keith Gessen teaches journalism at Columbia University and is the author of the forthcoming novel “A Terrible Country.” This is his first article for the magazine.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/opinion/mohammed-bin-salman-saudi-arabia.html,Can the Saudi Crown Prince Transform the Kingdom? Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor None None None None None None None The House of Saud realized the volatility of the state religion. But instead of trying to de-radicalize the radicals  the regime chose to indulge them and submit to their uncompromising agenda. The Camp David agreement between Israel and Egypt in 1979 also troubled many Saudis. Consequently  Saudi Arabia together with other Arab countries boycotted Egypt under pressure from local groups. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 provided an opportunity for Saudi Arabia to outdo Iran’s Islamic republic in displaying Islamic credentials. Saudi Arabia wanted to defuse the religious radicalism at home by letting its own jihadis seek martyrdom in Afghanistan. This eventually led to the emergence of global jihad under the leadership of Osama bin Laden. Notwithstanding Prince Mohammed’s sweeping and inaccurate comments about Saudi religious moderation before 1979  it is not clear how moderate Islam is going to change the religious outlook. If he is serious about getting the country to embrace moderate Islam  he must allow Saudi clerics and thinkers of different denominations to debate foundational Islamic texts and norms in an open environment. None Saudi religious education is still based on the Wahhabi heritage and judges follow the Hanbali jurisprudence  the foundation of Wahhabi literal interpretations of Islam. The founder of Wahhabism  Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab  is sacrosanct. When a scholar named Hijazi Hasan Farhan al-Maliki wrote a book suggesting that readers temper their unconditional endorsement of Wahhab  he was arrested. Saudi Arabia is still the only country in the Muslim world where non-Muslim places of worship are not allowed. Even in neighboring Gulf countries  Hindu temples and Christian churches exist. The crown prince did not hint whether that would change under the new moderate Islam he envisages. None Moderate Islam will not emerge in Saudi Arabia under a repressive regime whose foundation is based on purging theological difference and criminalizing the Muslim other. The regime’s main interest in religion is to gain legitimacy and pacify the Saudi population as Wahhabism justifies armed rebellion abroad against most Muslim leaders  but forbids Saudis from rising up against their own rulers. None None Only open debate will eventually lead to a kind of Islamic modernism and shrink the spaces where fundamentalism grows. But the regime will then be left without its raison d’être  as the protector of faith  defender of Muslims and the only truly Islamic state. Prince Mohammed will need a new legitimacy narrative to sell absolute rule to the populace. Economic development and employment opportunities may be key but since the new city he’s promoting will rely more on robots than humans  there is little hope there for young Saudis in search of a livelihood. The recent announcements about moderate Islam  the pervasive arrests  and the illusory hypermodern economic projects frame him as a ruthless modernizer  who is struggling to achieve too many things in too little time. But his motive is more about the consolidation of power than about corruption.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/opinion/9-11-trump.html,From 9/11 to Humpty Dumpty Advertisement Supported by None None None Words cascade from that pinched mouth and they mean nothing  because when a man of moral emptiness tries to exhort a nation to moral greatness the only thing communicated is pitiful  almost comical  hypocrisy. Between a hero and a huckster  between speaking and mouthing  the distance is great. Watching the esteemed leader’s head turning jerkily  like an old electric fan  from teleprompter to teleprompter  I almost felt pity. His is the Age of Indecency. None We’ve had a big fall. For the perpetrators of the attack on America  the biggest success has been the injection of fear into the national psyche. Not even they could imagine how social media could turn fear into contagion and how the politics of fear would help propel a buffoon with feral instincts to the White House. Looking back over the years since the attack that bright September morning — it was my daughter Adele’s 4th birthday and she had just recovered from an infection so serious I had to hold her little body while doctors performed a spinal tap — I am reminded of lines from Hemingway’s “The Sun Also Rises.” “How did you go bankrupt?” Bill asked. “Two ways ” Mike said. “Gradually and then suddenly.” First  there was the downward glide: the misbegotten war  the soldiers and shoppers  financial implosion  impunity for the mighty  recession  anxiety and polarization. Then Americans  and not only Americans  decided it was better to blow things up than have more of the same. That’s when things precipitated. The esteemed leader won even though Americans know he makes stuff up and wants a victorious small-to-medium-sized war that will allow him to proclaim American greatness restored. People do crazy things. They invade Russia  for example. Just look at history. Trump might think bombing Iran is his ticket in 2020. What is all the fear about? It’s the loss of sanctuary. Menace could be anywhere since it came out of a clear blue sky. It’s the loss of victory. There is none to be had. It’s the loss of confidence. America’s power is greater than its ability to use it. It’s the loss of community. Technology is a great connector but also a great isolator. It’s the loss of self-worth. Life in the Facebook age can become an endless invitation to feel inferior or unloved. All of this has fed a tissue of fear and disquiet easily exploited by the esteemed leader  whose instincts are above all for human weakness.

The worst of 9/11  almost a generation on  is the feeling that the perpetrators won. They didn’t buckle Western freedom and democracy  but they injured them. They disoriented the West. They sucked some of the promise out of a new century. The assassins of Abraham Lincoln and Mahatma Gandhi and John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King took the lives of great men but did not destroy their ideas. Perhaps they reinforced the immortality of those ideas. The assassin of Yitzhak Rabin and the mass murderers of 9/11 dispatched by Osama bin Laden were  however  more successful.

Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor None ISLAMABAD  Pakistan — For the past 16 years  whenever the United States has been faced with the reality of a failing war in Afghanistan  it has blamed Pakistan. Efforts to bring freedom to the valleys of Afghanistan  this narrative claims  have been thwarted by a double-dealing “ally” that takes American aid while supporting its enemies. The narrative inadvertently casts American presidents  generals  diplomats  spies and others who have been part of the war effort as credulous dupes and casts poor light on the American military  stuck in a quagmire despite having the world’s most advanced weapons and largest financial resources. It also assumes that Pakistan has a clear interest in harming both the United States and Afghanistan. Those assumptions are wrong. Pakistan joined President George W. Bush’s war on terrorism reluctantly but proved itself an effective ally in the fight against Al Qaeda and helped decimate its ranks. That contribution was sullied by Pakistan’s failure to locate Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad. After the Sept. 11 attacks  the United States established a partnership with Pakistan over a decade and a half — handing out substantial amounts of aid  sophisticated weapons and the status of major non-NATO ally. Pakistan continues to require American military hardware  and middle-class Pakistani children continue to dream of attending American universities and of working on Wall Street. The United States is the biggest market for Pakistani exports  and Pakistani-Americans form its seventh-largest diaspora group. None None None For its part  the United States has failed to convince Pakistan of the urgency of its primary interest in Afghanistan — shutting down the Haqqani network  the principal planner and executor of the most lethal terrorist attacks in Afghanistan over the past decade. Pakistanis have hemmed and hawed  offering up low-level Haqqani operatives and occasionally trimming the space available to them. None Neither Pakistan nor the United States has been able to convince the Taliban to negotiate in good faith for a peaceful settlement in Afghanistan — the one supposed issue on which there is a complete convergence between the two countries. None None None President Trump’s threats and his unpredictability have filled Pakistan with anxiety about what may be coming despite a difficult history. American drones have already dropped tons of ordnance  Navy SEALs have already dropped in to assassinate terrorists  American military and civilian assistance has already dropped to a trickle of what it was. And the trust between Pakistani generals and American commanders in Afghanistan is already at a historical low. None Pakistan’s willingness to lose American patronage is the clearest indicator that its interests in Afghanistan are not a product of ambition  or grandeur  but of deep and existential fears about the damage an unchecked India can do to Pakistan. Until Americans learn how to have an honest conversation with India about what Pakistan sees as its proxy warfare in Afghanistan and its brutal occupation of Kashmir  no amount of threats to Pakistan will help. Countries can be weaned from many things  but not from protecting themselves. Pakistan is definitely a problem in Afghanistan  but it is a problem of America’s making.

He added: “Special operations should not be the panacea for every kind of difficulty that we find ourselves around the world facing  to include terrorism.” None The success was the 1976 Israeli commando raid on the Entebbe airport in Uganda  where Palestinian militants and allied German radicals had flown an Air France plane they hijacked. Abetted by Uganda’s erratic dictator  Idi Amin  the hijackers held more than 100 hostages for a week. Nearly all were Israelis  threatened with death unless their country and several others released Palestinian prisoners. They seemed doomed  given that Israel had a policy of not negotiating with terrorists and that Uganda seemed too far away for even the long arm of the Israeli military. None None They were so good that the United States tried something similar in April 1980 to end a hostage crisis in Iran that traumatized this country. Fifty-two United States diplomats and other citizens had been taken captive five months earlier under a new Iranian theocracy hostile to America. From the get-go  this rescue mission  code-named Eagle Claw  would not be an easy assignment for a Delta Force commando unit still in its infancy. “The only difference between this and the Alamo is Davy Crockett didn’t have to fight his way in ” said Mr. Ishimoto  who was an intelligence officer on the Delta Force raid. Almost everything that could have gone wrong did. Two American helicopters were disabled by severe dust storms over Iran. Separately  a third one broke down. Still another crashed into a tanker aircraft  eight servicemen were killed. It was a disaster that left America humiliated — and left the hostages stuck for nine more months. None With Americans weary of war without end since Sept. 11  2001  President Obama withdrew most conventional soldiers from Iraq and Afghanistan. At the same time  he turned the Joint Special Operations Command into a dray horse. Its members are just about everywhere: Afghanistan  Iraq  Yemen  Syria  Somalia  Pakistan  you name it. Their impact can be deadly. But their footprint is lighter  and less costly  than that of a fully decked-out Army operation. This commando force plainly appeals to Mr. Trump  who has shown scant faith in “soft power ” the use of diplomacy and humanitarian example to win friends and influence nations. His budget proposals have included many billions more for the Defense Department and billions less for the State Department and the Agency for International Development. In his first half-year in office  military special operators were sent on about five times as many lethal missions in what for the United States are non-battlefield countries — Yemen  Pakistan and Somalia — as there had been during Mr. Obama’s final six months. None It’s easy to romanticize commandos. Just ask any Hollywood director. But they are not supermen. Even Israeli forces have lost their post-Entebbe glow  with blemished missions in Lebanon and Gaza that led to their own men and innocent civilians being killed. Some military experts worry that even though the American teams also have chutzpah and are damn good  they are being asked to do too much too often. “These guys truly are amazing warriors ” Russell D. Howard  a retired brigadier general who was a special forces commander  told The Cipher Brief  a website focused on security issues. “But they’re more than that. They’re smart  flexible  adaptable and unafraid.” The problem  General Howard said  is that “the guys are still deployed all the time.” “These guys are a national treasure ” he said. “In my day  it cost an average of $1 million to train a special forces soldier. Now it probably costs closer to $1.5 million  and you don’t waste that asset. You use them judiciously when you really need them.” None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,terrorism

Taliban fighters who had previously controlled the extensive cave and tunnel complex fled overnight after a determined  weeklong assault by the Islamic State  also known as ISIS or ISIL  according to villagers fleeing the area on Wednesday. None The Islamic State then decided to shift its refuge to the Tora Bora caves and tunnels  Mr. Ali said. “Some 1 000 ISIS militants were gathered close to Tora Bora  to capture the area ” Mr. Ali said. “I informed government forces to target them  and I told them they are trying to capture Tora Bora  but they did not pay attention.” A local Afghan police official confirmed that the fortress had fallen. “ISIS has captured Tora Bora and areas around it ” he said. “The tribal elders are here in my office. They all escaped the area last night.” He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media. Zabihullah Mujahid  the spokesman for the Taliban in that area  denied that Tora Bora had fallen to their rival insurgents. “Fighting is underway in the Tora Bora area between ISIS and our mujahedeen ” Mr. Mujahid said via the Viber messaging service. “It is the front line between our mujahedeen and ISIS. No one has advanced in the area.” He accused the United States of carrying out airstrikes in support of the Islamic State  but local officials and residents denied hearing any. Residents said the Taliban had fled. “The Taliban escaped from the area last night and left us to ISIS with our women and children ” said Juma Gul  a tribal elder from the Suleymankhel Valley  close to Tora Bora  who said his was among hundreds of families who fled the area after the Islamic State took over. “There was no resistance by the Taliban against ISIS  and local tribes had no way to fight them anymore  so we just escaped.” The militants now have an easily defended base at Tora Bora  Mr. Ali said  as well as access to many other parts of Nangarhar Province through the Spin Ghar mountains along the Pakistan border  where Tora Bora sits. “ISIS has a stronghold and will capture these areas one after another ” he said. None Mr. Ali has denied having done so. The Islamic State in Khorasan  as the militants in Afghanistan and Pakistan are known  has no direct connection with Al Qaeda  which is largely a spent force in the area. But the Islamic State was originally formed by Qaeda elements  and the two groups have many doctrinal similarities. Government forces and their coalition allies in the Tora Bora area have engaged in little recent fighting against the Taliban who have been entrenched there  supported by local tribes along the mountainous border with Pakistan. But since March  Afghan forces supported by American Special Operations troops have been mounting a vigorous campaign against the Islamic State in Achin District  also in the Spin Ghar range but about 50 miles to the east of Tora Bora. None None Taliban officials are concerned about the Islamic State’s appeal to younger fighters impatient with the progress of the 15-year insurgency. In the Tora Bora area  residents were angry at both the Taliban and the government for allowing the Islamic State to take over. Malak Tor  a tribal elder from Pachir Agam District  where Tora Bora is situated  complained that residents’ demands that the government mount an offensive to protect Tora Bora were ignored. Among other things  the Islamic State insurgents had taken a large marble quarry as well as a fuel depot. “Now they will find financial resources for themselves  and then it will be very difficult to push them out of Tora Bora ” Mr. Tor said. President Ashraf Ghani on Wednesday ordered the 201st Corps of the Afghan National Army to move against the Islamic State in the districts including the Tora Bora area  according to Attaullah Khogyani  the spokesman for the Nangarhar Province governor.

https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/world/asia/osama-bin-laden-was-bullish-on-gold.html,As an Investor  Osama bin Laden Was Bullish on Gold Advertisement Supported by Washington Memo None None None In a letter that he wrote in December 2010  Bin Laden instructed Al Qaeda’s general manager to set aside a third of the ransom — nearly $1.7 million — to buy gold bars and coins. The letter  written in Arabic  was part of the trove of intelligence seized by Navy SEALs in the raid on Bin Laden’s compound in Abbottabad  Pakistan  in 2011 that was declassified last month by the Central Intelligence Agency. It offers a glimpse into how Al Qaeda sought to manage its finances and what militant groups have tried to do with the money they raised. “The overall price trend is upward ” Bin Laden wrote to Atiyah Abd al-Rahman  the Qaeda general manager. “Even with occasional drops  in the next few years the price of gold will reach $3 000 an ounce.” Bin Laden may have lacked investing acumen — gold peaked at $1 900 an ounce five months after his death in 2011 — but he seems to have had a keen sense of the financial zeitgeist. His belief in gold’s bright future was shared at the time by many Americans and a number of financial luminaries  including George Soros and John Paulson  both of whom were investing heavily in the precious metal. Demand was so high that in 2010  JPMorgan Chase reopened a long-closed vault used to store gold under the streets of downtown Manhattan. It is probably safe to assume that if Al Qaeda bought gold — American officials could not say whether Bin Laden’s instructions were followed in this case — the militants did not hand it over to JPMorgan for safekeeping. But American officials believe that the group had previously relied on gold as a safe haven and an alternative currency to the dollar. Al Qaeda would also have had access to gold brokers in Pakistan’s tribal areas and the loosely regulated gold market in Dubai  United Arab Emirates  at the time Bin Laden wrote his letter. “There was always speculation about how Al Qaeda kept excess capital ” said Juan C. Zarate  a deputy national security adviser during the George W. Bush administration who led American efforts to track the militants’ assets after 2001. “They grew worried that we were able to do things with the dollar that influenced their ability to access it  to demand things of financial institutions.” Like Al Qaeda  other Islamist militant groups have wrestled with how to avoid the reach of the Treasury and international blacklists. Their wealth management strategies have varied  and some have proved more adept at making money than investing it. None The Haqqani network  a Taliban faction that is especially close to Al Qaeda  is believed to have poured money into real estate in Afghanistan  Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates. A European official  who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence  said the Haqqanis are believed to have been hit hard by the real estate crash in Dubai  United Arab Emirates  a few years ago. Still  despite the occasional bursting bubble  real estate appears to have been a relatively safe investment  particularly in South Asia  where there is little regulation. In a letter to Al Qaeda's general manager  declassified by the Central Intelligence Agency  Osama bin Laden discussed what to do with a ransom that had been paid for an Afghan diplomat that it had held captive. “You can show up with a suitcase full of cash and buy a house ” said Gretchen Peters  who runs the Satao Project  a consulting firm that focuses on organized crime and terrorism. “It’s not like there is an I.R.S. money-laundering unit that’s going to come for you.” None Al Qaeda had the money in hand by the time Bin Laden sat down to write his general manager in December 2010. Bin Laden clearly wanted nothing to do with United States dollars  which many Islamist militants fear could expose them to the long reach of American justice. “As for the ransom money for the Afghan prisoner  I think you should use one-third of the money to buy gold and another third to buy euros ” he wrote. The remainder  Bin Laden said  should be used to buy Kuwaiti dinars and Chinese renminbi  also known as yuan  with about a third kept in local currencies to cover day-to-day expenses. “When you do spend this money  use the euros first  then the dinars  the yuan  and then the gold ” he wrote. Bin Laden had specific instructions for how to acquire the gold. It should be bought in coins or bars  which he referred to as “10 tolas ” a common denomination for gold bars in South Asia. Coins “are minted in several countries ” he wrote  naming Switzerland  South Africa and the United Arab Emirates. None He also suggested buying a small amount of gold and reselling it to make sure the broker was honest. Bin Laden appears to have believed that done right  investing in gold was nearly a sure thing. “Right now it is $1 390 an ounce  but before the events in New York and Washington it was $280 an ounce ” he wrote. He added  “If the price of gold reaches $1 500 or a little over before you get this message  it’s still all right to buy it.” If Al Qaeda bought gold when Bin Laden advised  it was a bad bet. The day his letter was dated  Dec. 3  2010  gold closed at $1 414.08 an ounce. Today  the price is hovering around $1 230 an ounce.  Alexandra Stevenson in New York contributed reporting.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/29/books/review-anatomy-of-terror-ali-soufan.html,A Former F.B.I. Agent on Terrorism Since the Death of Bin Laden Advertisement Supported by Books of The Times None None In his revealing and timely new book  “Anatomy of Terror ” the former F.B.I. special agent Ali Soufan compares Al Qaeda and its vicious spinoff  the Islamic State  to the Hydra from Greek mythology: Cut off one head and two more quickly sprout. More than a decade and a half after Sept. 11  and a half-dozen years after the killing of Osama bin Laden  he writes  “the cancer of bin Ladenism has metastasized across the Middle East and North Africa and beyond  carried by even more virulent vectors.” “Whereas on 9/11 Al Qaeda had around 400 members ” he goes on  “today it has thousands upon thousands  in franchises and affiliates spread from the shores of the Pacific to Africa’s Atlantic seaboard.” And he notes that bin Laden’s 20-something son Hamza — who “grew up with a fervor for jihad and a determination to follow” in his father’s footsteps — is “being prepared for leadership” with several of his father’s most trusted lieutenants. Meanwhile  the Islamic State has brought mass murder to Iraq and Syria  and conducted or inspired attacks in more than two dozen countries  the group claimed responsibility for last week’s deadly bombing in Manchester  England. None None In “The Black Banners ” Soufan provided a compelling insider’s account of American efforts to track down the perpetrators of Sept. 11  and recounted the story of Al Qaeda up through the death of bin Laden. His new book covers some of the same ground  but focuses on that terrorist group after bin Laden’s death  and how it and the Islamic State have evolved since — their different philosophies and divergent trajectories  and how the personalities of their leaders have shaped the organizations. Of the relationship between the soft-spoken bin Laden and Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi  the fiery militant who founded the group that would become the Islamic State  Soufan quotes an intelligence officer: It was a case of “loathing at first sight.” None Soufan underscores the disastrous role that the United States invasion of Iraq and its bungled occupation played in fueling terrorism  creating chaos and a power vacuum in Iraq — the perfect incubator for insurgent violence and bloodshed. Two calamitous decisions made by the Americans (dissolving the Iraqi Army and banning members of Saddam Hussein’s Baath Party from positions of authority) would prove fateful. Soufan writes that embittered and unemployed “former Baathists soon became the backbone of the new Islamic State of Iraq.” He adds  “With their governmental  intelligence  and military experience  these men made themselves essential both to ISI’s battlefield achievements and to the terror tactics it has deployed against ordinary citizens.” He lucidly describes the nefarious modus operandi (borrowed  in part  from Hussein’s regime) by which ISI — which would be renamed ISIL (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) or ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria)  and later simply IS  the Islamic State — began aggressively conquering territory in Iraq and Syria in 2013. It would start  in each town  by opening what appeared to be a religious community center  then selecting fervent young men “to inform on their neighbors and spy on any rival rebel groups in the area.” While gathering intelligence and blackmail material on residents  Soufan explains: “ISIL would begin concentrating its fighters in the area — typically foreigners who would have less compunction about killing or subjugating the natives. When the local faction judged that it had amassed enough manpower and enough leverage with the local population  it would go public and seize the municipal government  violently if necessary.” Leaders of rival groups would be assassinated  and anyone who opposed ISIL’s rule would be killed — terror tactics that compelled allegiance from local tribes. In other chapters  Soufan gives a detailed portrait of Al Qaeda’s more bureaucratic operation  describing bin Laden’s long view of history and his penchant for micromanagement. (“Please send me the résumés of all the brothers who might be nominated for high administrative positions now or in the future.”) Such passages give a keen sense of how these terrorist groups operate day to day. Soufan also uses some of the techniques he learned as an interrogator to get inside the heads of his subjects  mapping the factors that lead many to become jihadis  and the ways Al Qaeda and the Islamic State use publicity and propaganda to recruit members and promote their brand. “Know your enemy ” he quotes Sun Tzu  adding that empathy is a useful tool in this war — “not in the colloquial sense of sharing another person’s perspective  but in the clinical sense of being able to see the world through another person’s eyes.” By understanding Al Qaeda and the Islamic State  he writes  we can better “combat the destructive ideology they represent.” None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,terrorism

Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor None Mr. Gardner  a Republican from Colorado  is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Despite the imposition of unprecedented sanctions against Russia by the Trump administration and Congress over the past year  President Vladimir Putin only seems more intent on causing grievous harm to international peace and stability. Alongside increased financial sanctions against Mr. Putin and his cronies  there is another arrow in the American quiver that would add diplomatic pressure against Russia: The State Department should consider adding the country to its list of state sponsors of terrorism  alongside its close allies Iran and Syria. The moral case for such a designation is sound. Russia has invaded its neighbors Georgia and Ukraine  it supports the murderous regime of Bashar al-Assad and our enemies in Afghanistan  and it is engaged in active information warfare against Western democracies  including meddling in the 2016 United States elections. None Russia has denied the charges  but the evidence is overwhelming. So is the attack’s significance: Russia is now officially responsible for a chemical weapons attack against a NATO member state on its own soil — a brazen violation of sovereignty of our closest ally. It requires a serious American response. This startling confirmation comes on the heels of horrendous chemical weapons attacks by Mr. Assad against his own people in Syria. He is in power only because the Kremlin provides him with extensive diplomatic  military and economic support. The use of chemical weapons against civilians is illegal under international law  particularly the Chemical Weapons Convention. In fact  Syria’s illicit chemical program is part of the reason the United States continues to designate Syria as a state sponsor of terrorism. None We also know that Russia is ramping up its support for anti-American insurgents in Afghanistan. On Feb. 9  2017  Gen. John Nicholson  the American commander in Afghanistan  told the Senate Armed Services Committee that Russia has “begun to publicly legitimize the Taliban” as a means “to undermine the United States and NATO.” None None Some will argue that applying such a toxic label to a major global power  one with a permanent seat at the United Nations Security Council  will not get it to back down  and might even further damage American-Russia ties  already at an all-time low. Those are important policy questions  which is why my legislation leaves a final determination to the professionals at the State Department. However  it is clear that the blame for today’s distrust and tensions between Moscow and Washington lies entirely with the Kremlin and its atrocious behavior. We must take every diplomatic step necessary to protect our allies and our democracy  and to deter a revanchist Russia that is intent on rewriting history and threatening our way of life.

In them she meets a young Canadian who discloses that he left his country behind to become an Islamic State fighter. He made his way back to Canada without being arrested under its antiterrorism laws. This week I asked Rukmini about her job and the podcast. (Our conversation has been edited and condensed.) Q: What was the path that took you to reporting on terrorism? A: I literally stumbled into this beat more than five years ago  when I walked into a building in northern Mali that had served as a headquarters for a group of Al Qaeda fighters. On the floor was a piece of paper. I picked it up and saw that it was written in Arabic and went  “I can’t read that ” and dropped it back down. It was that night at my hotel that I realized that the very fact that it was written in Arabic — a language spoken by the invading fighters which is not spoken in Francophone Mali — meant that the document I had dropped back on the floor was most likely written by Al Qaeda. I returned the next day to that building and to over a dozen others  collecting thousands of pages of their internal records which upended my understanding of the terrorist group. I realized that so much of what I had been told by officials about this organization was wrong  and that if I could contribute to our understanding of terrorism by trying to go to the source — namely the group’s records  their fighters and those who have interacted with them. That was the start of the journey I am still on today. A question that I suspect that you’re often asked: is your assignment dangerous? I don’t like to talk about this because the purpose of our work is to shed light on the issues facing our world and not to draw attention to ourselves. But yes  the document hunting is especially difficult because ISIS mined many of the buildings they occupied. It’s why I never enter these buildings alone. My team was always embedded with Iraqi troops  who took the greatest risk by entering the buildings first and who then watched over us as we searched for documents. There were numerous buildings that they deemed were too risky to enter. In one  we searched the front part of the house and then suddenly the troops started shouting and all of us ran outside. It was in the courtyard that they explained that they had discovered an unexploded I.E.D. in one of the side rooms  which they believed had been rigged to blow when we opened the door to the room. The podcast means that you now have a colleague from The Times along when you’re reporting. Has that brought any changes  either good or bad? My work is often very solitary. It’s usually just me flying to the country where I am reporting  staying by myself in a hotel and then meeting up with our translators and fixers during the day. When I’m writing  it’s even lonelier. It was so much fun to have my audio colleague Andy Mills for one of my trips to Iraq. He was at my side for almost four weeks. We slept on the roofs of abandoned buildings together. We embedded with troops and searched buildings side by side. And then back in New York  it was such a rush to be able to work with a team — including producers Larissa Anderson and Asthaa Chaturvedi and our editors Wendy Dorr and Sam Dolnick. We all shared in the creation of this project. Does the podcast allow you to tell stories that elude the printed word? None While “Caliphate” takes a generally sober look at a serious subject  it’s tone is very human and  at times  even funny. New episodes are available every Thursday. Those of you who are Times subscribers can listen to episodes a week before everyone else  assuming that you are logged in to The Times’s site. On May 11  Rukmini will be in Toronto to discuss her podcast at the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management. In addition to playing excerpts from her podcast  Rukmini will analyze the current state of the terrorism threat with Janice Gross Stein  founding director of the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto  and Amarnath Amarasingam  an author and researcher.

I was never ashamed to be a server of Jesus but these claims are shameful and disgusting "" Brunson told the court in the Aegean town of Aliaga  north of Izmir. Brunson has been the pastor of Izmir Resurrection Church  serving a small Protestant congregation in Turkey's third largest city. ""I want to return to my home "" Brunson said at the end of the hearing  before the judge ruled that he should be kept in custody  adjourning the case to July 18.  TURKEY WANTS GULEN EXTRADITED Brunson's legal case is among several roiling U.S.-Turkish relations  including one in New York against a former executive of Turkish state lender Halkbank. The two countries are also at odds over U.S. support for the Kurdish militia in northern Syria  which Turkey considers a terrorist organization. Erdogan suggested last year Brunson's fate could be linked to that of Gulen  whom Turkey wants extradited. Gulen denies any association with the coup attempt. Tens of thousands of Turks have been arrested or lost their jobs over alleged connections with it. U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted after Brunson's first court appearance last month that the pastor was on trial for ""no reason"". ""They call him a spy  but I am more a spy than he is. Hopefully he will be allowed to come home to his beautiful family where he belongs!"" Trump said. Outside the court on Monday  Sandra Jolley  vice chair of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom  called for the clergyman's release. ""Every day that Andrew Brunson spends here in prison is another day that the standing of the Turkish government diminishes in the eyes of not just the U.S. but the entire world "" she told reporters. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu  who is expected to meet with U.S. counterpart Mike Pompeo in Washington this week or next  said on Saturday any decision was up to the court. ""They say that the government should release him "" he said. ""Is it in my power? This is a decision the judiciary will make.""

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/21/opinion/terrorism-immigration.html,Homegrown Terrorism Advertisement Supported by Letter To the Editor: None The Trump administration’s report trying to link foreign-born immigrants to terrorism muddies the waters by giving an incomplete picture of the sources of extremist violence in America. None More than 70 percent of all extremist-related killings in those years were linked to domestic right-wing extremists  while 26 percent of the killings were committed by Islamic extremists. And last year  in the heated political environment that led to Charlottesville  Va.  deaths caused by white supremacists doubled year over year. Right-wing extremists were directly responsible for 20 of the total 34 extremist-related murders in 2017. While the federal government builds walls and pours more resources into fighting the violent threat posed by foreign extremists  less attention is being paid to the reality of right-wing violence.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/25/world/europe/turkey-journalists-trial-cumhuriyet.html,Turkish Court Convicts 13 From Cumhuriyet Newspaper on Terrorism Charges Advertisement Supported by None ISTANBUL — A Turkish court convicted 13 employees of Cumhuriyet  Turkey’s oldest independent newspaper  of terrorism-related crimes on Wednesday  and handed down stiff sentences for several of them even while ordering the release of the newspaper’s chief executive. The defendants — journalists  managers and two lawyers  most of whom had been released from jail during the monthslong trial — received sentences of two to seven years in prison  but they will remain free while their cases are appealed. The chief executive  Akin Atalay  the executive chairman of the Cumhuriyet Foundation  which manages the newspaper  was the last of the group still in jail. The court ordered his release on Wednesday evening  but he was barred from traveling abroad. Mr. Atalay  along with several other defendants  was acquitted of a charge of misuse of authority but convicted of helping terrorist organizations. Supporters and press freedom groups denounced the verdicts as travesty of justice. Despite the court’s ruling  the journalists remained defiant. “This neither scares me nor Cumhuriyet newspaper ” Murat Sabuncu  the newspaper’s editor in chief and one of those convicted  said in a statement after the verdict. “I see this as an attack against us and against all the journalism community  against all our colleagues for us not to practice journalism in Turkey  to be scared while doing it ” Mr. Sabuncu added. “We can go to jail one more time if necessary. We will go on doing journalism with courage.” The defendants convicted on Wednesday were part of a larger group of 18. Three were acquitted  and the cases of two others — as well as two not associated with the newspaper — will continue. None The defendants were charged with lending support to several terrorist organizations  including the movement of an Islamist cleric  Fethullah Gulen  who is accused by the Turkish government of masterminding the failed coup of 2016 from exile in the United States  the Kurdish separatist movement  the Kurdistan Workers’ Party  and an extreme-left party known as the DHKP-C. Prosecutors accused members of the group of helping terrorist organizations  through telephone and internet contacts  and in some cases through an encrypted telephone application called ByLock. The executives and board members were also accused of changing the editorial direction of the newspaper to support the groups. The prosecutors had demanded lengthy prison sentences for all the defendants  ranging from seven years to 43 years. The defendants and the management of Cumhuriyet denied all the charges and have accused the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of organizing a political trial to silence its critics. Defending themselves against the charges  some of the journalists offered examples of their work to show that they had been critical of the same organizations they were accused of supporting. Mr. Atalay had been in detention for more than 17 months  including months of pretrial detention. Mr. Sabuncu  the editor in chief  and the others were released at different stages during the trial  which began last July. Their lengthy pretrial detention — it took prosecutors nine months to produce an indictment — and the lack of convincing evidence supporting the charges  led to accusations from the journalists  their lawyers and press freedom organizations that the trial was politically motivated. In a statement before the verdict was announced  the Vienna-based International Press Institute said Cumhuriyet and its journalists were prosecuted because they critically reported on the activities of Turkey’s government and the governing Justice and Development Party. “Prosecutors have produced no concrete evidence for the charges of links to terrorist organizations ” Caroline Stockford  the press institute’s coordinator for Turkey  said in the statement. “Anything other than a complete acquittal and compensation for the defendants for the violation of their rights will be an outright injustice.” In their statements in court on Wednesday  the defendants expressed a determination to continue their work as journalists. “We  Cumhuriyet  will never give up resisting against evil  which is the reason of our existence ” Mr. Atalay said. Kadri Gursel  a senior columnist and an adviser to the newspaper’s board  said: “We were arrested because we are journalists and exercise journalism. We will continue to exercise our profession no matter how hard it is to do so in the absence of law and justice.” Musa Kart  the newspaper’s cartoonist  said  “With this trial  months have been stolen from our lives  but they cannot steal our hopes for a better future for our country.” There are about 160 journalists currently behind bars in Turkey  most of them detained in a government crackdown that closed 170 news media outlets in the aftermath of the 2016 coup attempt.
